# Tako Specification

This is the finalized specification for Tako. It describes the system as designed and implemented. Keep this in sync with code changes - when you modify code, update the corresponding sections here.

## Project Overview

Tako is a deployment and development platform consisting of:

- **`tako` CLI** - Local tool for development, deployment, server/secret management
- **`tako-server`** - Remote server binary that manages app processes, routing, and rolling updates
- **SDKs** - Runtime helpers for JavaScript/TypeScript (`tako.sh`), Go (`tako.sh`), and Rust (`tako`)

Built in Rust (2024 edition). Uses Pingora (Cloudflare's proxy) for production-grade performance.

## Design Goals

**Performance:** On par with Nginx, faster than Caddy. Built in Rust leveraging Pingora.

**Simplicity:** Opinionated defaults, minimal configuration, convention over configuration.

**Reliability:** Strong test coverage, graceful edge case handling, users can delete files/folders safely with recovery paths.

**Extensibility:** Support JavaScript runtimes (Bun, Node) and Go as native app runtimes, with runtime behavior isolated in plugins.

## Configuration

### App Name Requirements

App names must be URL-friendly (DNS hostname compatible):

- **Allowed:** lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), hyphens (-)
- **Must start with:** lowercase letter
- **Must end with:** lowercase letter or number
- **Maximum length:** 63 characters
- **Examples:** `my-app`, `api-server`, `web-frontend`

This ensures names work in DNS (`{app-name}.test` by default), URLs, and environment variables.
`name` is optional in `tako.toml`. If omitted, Tako resolves app name from the selected config file's parent directory name.
Using top-level `name` is recommended for stability. Remote server identity is `{name}/{env}`, so the same app name can be deployed to multiple environments on one server. Renaming `name` later creates a new app identity/path; delete the old deployment manually.

### tako.toml (Default Project Config)

Default application configuration file for build, variables, routes, and deployment.
App-scoped commands use `./tako.toml` by default. Passing `-c/--config <file>` selects a
different config file and treats that file's parent directory as the project directory.
The config file's parent directory is the app directory (there is no separate `app_dir` field).

```toml
name = "my-app"              # Optional but recommended stable identity used by deploy/dev
main = "server/index.mjs"   # Optional override; required only when preset does not define `main`
runtime = "bun@1.2.3"        # Optional override and version pin; defaults to detected adapter/version
container = "Dockerfile"     # Optional container release file; omit for native releases
package_manager = "bun"      # Optional override; auto-detected from package.json or lockfiles
preset = "tanstack-start"   # Optional app preset; provides `main`, `assets`, and `dev` defaults
app_root = "src"             # Optional JS app root for channels/workflows; default: "src"
dev = ["vite", "dev"]        # Optional custom dev command override
start = ["./app"]            # Optional native artifact start command for deploys
assets = ["dist/client"]     # Optional asset directories for deploy artifact
release = "bun run db:migrate"   # Optional release command (run once on the leader server before rolling update)

[images]
remote_patterns = ["https://cdn.example.com/uploads/**"] # Optional public remote image allowlist

# qualities = [75]

[build]
run = "vinxi build"       # Build command

```

**Variable merging order (later overrides earlier):**

1. `[vars]` - base
2. `[vars.{environment}]` - environment-specific
3. Auto-set by Tako at runtime: `ENV={environment}` in dev, local run, and deploy; `TAKO_BUILD=local` for `tako run`; `TAKO_BUILD={version}` on deploys; `TAKO_DATA_DIR=<app data dir>` in dev, local run, and native deploys; `TAKO_APP_ROOT` for JS apps; plus runtime env vars (e.g. `NODE_ENV` for all JS runtimes, `BUN_ENV` for Bun)

Variable values may be TOML strings, numbers, booleans, or datetimes. Tako converts them to strings before injection because process environment values are strings. Arrays and tables are not valid variable values.

`ENV` is reserved. If you set `ENV` in `[vars]` or `[vars.{environment}]`, Tako ignores it and prints a warning. `LOG_LEVEL` (and any other log-verbosity env var your framework reads) is owned by you — set it in `[vars]` / `[vars.<env>]` if you want it per environment.

**Build/deploy behavior:**

- `name` in `tako.toml` is optional.
- App name resolution order for deploy/dev/logs/secrets/delete:
  1. top-level `name` (when set)
  2. sanitized selected-config parent directory name fallback
- Remote deployment identity on servers is `{app}/{env}`. Set `name` explicitly to keep the `{app}` segment stable across deploys.
- Renaming app identity (`name` or directory fallback) is treated as a different app; remove the previous deployment manually if needed.
- `app_root` is a JS-only app source root relative to `tako.toml`. It defaults to `src`; use `.` for root-level JS app files. Tako discovers `<app_root>/channels/` and `<app_root>/workflows/` there. It does not change `main`, `assets`, generated declaration placement, build paths, or deploy packaging roots.
- `main` in `tako.toml` is an optional runtime entrypoint override written to deployed `app.json`. It accepts file paths and module specifiers (e.g. `@scope/pkg`).
- If `main` is omitted in `tako.toml`, deploy/dev check the manifest main field (e.g. `package.json` `main`), then fall back to preset `main`.
- For JS adapters (`bun`, `node`), when preset `main` is `index.<ext>` or `src/index.<ext>` (`ext`: `ts`, `tsx`, `js`, `jsx`), deploy/dev resolve in this order: existing `index.<ext>`, then existing `src/index.<ext>`, then preset `main`.
- If neither `tako.toml main`, manifest main, nor preset `main` is set, deploy/dev fail with guidance.
- Top-level `runtime` is optional; when set to `bun`, `node`, or `go`, it overrides adapter detection for default preset selection in `tako deploy`/`tako dev`. Add `@<version>` (for example `bun@1.2.3`) to pin the deploy runtime version. Without a pin, deploy auto-detects with `<runtime> --version`. `tako init` pins the locally-installed version by default. When top-level `start` is set, deploy can package a native artifact without detecting or installing a runtime.
- Top-level `container` is optional. When set, production deploys package source for a container release instead of the native runtime artifact flow. The path is relative to the config file's parent directory and must not be absolute or contain `..`.
- Native release packaging fields are invalid with `container`: `main`, `start`, `assets`, `[build]`, and `[[build_stages]]`. The container file and `.dockerignore` own production build inputs and outputs for container releases. `tako dev` still uses the configured dev command, preset dev command, or native runtime default; it does not build or run the container file locally.
- Container releases use Podman on the target server. `tako servers add` installs Podman, and server upgrade installs it when missing. During remote prepare, `tako-server` builds the image from the uploaded app directory, tags it as `tako/{app}-{env}:{version}`, and runs HTTP instances from that image without overriding the image `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD`. The container receives `HOST=0.0.0.0`, `PORT=3000`, `ENV`, `TAKO_BUILD`, user vars, and `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`. The app must use the Tako SDK so secrets, storage bindings, internal status, and the health-probe token use the same contract as native releases.
- Container HTTP instances do not receive the fd 3 bootstrap, fd 4 readiness handshake, internal socket, or `TAKO_DATA_DIR` in v0. A configured workflow `run` command starts a separate container process from the same image; Tako replaces the image entrypoint with `run[0]`, passes `run[1..]` as arguments, mounts the internal socket, and sends the bootstrap envelope through `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`. Container releases support one workflow `run` command in v0.
- Top-level `package_manager` is optional; when set (e.g. `"npm"`, `"pnpm"`, `"yarn"`, `"bun"`), it overrides auto-detection from `package.json` `packageManager` field or lockfiles.
- Top-level `preset` is optional. Presets are metadata-only (`name`, `main`, `assets`, `dev`) providing entrypoint, asset, and dev-command defaults. They do not contain build, install, or start commands.
- Top-level `dev` is optional; when set (e.g. `["vite", "dev"]`), it overrides both preset and runtime default dev commands for `tako dev`.
- Top-level `start` is optional; when set (e.g. `["./app"]`), it is written to the native deploy manifest and `tako-server` runs that command directly from the app directory. An exact `{main}` argument is replaced with the resolved `main` path for runtime-style commands. This is the native artifact mode for compiled binaries such as Rust apps. The process must still use a Tako SDK listener so fd 3 bootstrap, fd 4 readiness, status checks, secrets, storages, and rolling updates work. When `start` is omitted, deploy falls back to the selected runtime/preset launch command and prints a warning.
- Top-level `assets` is optional; lists asset directories to include in the deploy artifact (e.g. `["dist/client"]`). Asset roots are preset `assets` plus top-level `assets` (deduplicated).
- `[images]` is optional public image optimizer config. Local public paths are allowed by default with `local_patterns = ["/**"]`; setting `local_patterns` replaces that default. Remote images are denied unless their full URL matches `remote_patterns`. Patterns are glob-like URL strings, not regular expressions: `*` matches one path segment, `**` matches the rest of a path, and remote hosts may use a leading wildcard such as `https://*.example.com/uploads/**`. Remote patterns without a protocol match both `http` and `https`.
- Public image sizes default to `[320, 640, 960, 1200, 1920]`, qualities default to `[75]`, and formats default to `["webp"]`. The `formats` order is the negotiation preference when a request omits `f`.
- Top-level `release` is optional. When set, deploy runs the command once
  on the **leader server** (first entry in `[envs.<env>].servers`) inside
  the new release directory after extract + production install but
  before any rolling update.
- `[envs.<env>].release` overrides the top-level value for that
  environment. An empty string (`release = ""`) explicitly clears the
  inherited top-level command for that env.
- The release command runs as `sh -c "<command>"` with cwd set to the
  new release directory, the app's per-app Unix identity on root-managed
  production servers, and the same env an HTTP instance receives
  (merged `[vars]` + `[vars.<env>]` + secrets + `TAKO_BUILD` +
  `TAKO_DATA_DIR` + `ENV` + runtime defaults). Secrets are injected as
  env vars (release commands are one-shot; the fd 3 mechanism is
  reserved for long-running app/worker processes).
- Hard timeout: 10 minutes per release-command invocation. On timeout,
  the process is killed and deploy fails.
- `preset` supports:
  - runtime-local aliases: `tanstack-start`, `nextjs` (resolved under selected runtime, e.g. `runtime = "bun"`)
  - pinned runtime-local aliases: `tanstack-start@<commit-hash>`, `nextjs@<commit-hash>`
- namespaced preset aliases in `tako.toml` (for example `js/tanstack-start`) are rejected; choose runtime via top-level `runtime` and keep `preset` runtime-local.
- `github:` preset references are not supported in `tako.toml`.
- Preset definitions live in `presets/<language>.toml` (for example `presets/javascript.toml`), where each preset is a section (`[tanstack-start]`, etc.). Each section contains `name` (optional, fallback: section name), `main`, `assets`, and `dev` (custom dev command). Tako caches fetched preset manifests locally. `tako dev` prefers cached or embedded preset data and only fetches from GitHub when nothing local is available; deploy refreshes unpinned aliases from GitHub and falls back to cached content on fetch failure.
- `tanstack-start` preset defaults `main = "dist/server/tako-entry.mjs"`, `assets = ["dist/client"]`, and `dev = ["vite", "dev"]`. The `main` file is emitted by `tako.sh/vite` during `vite build` and wraps the SSR bundle with tako endpoint handling.
- `nextjs` preset defaults `main = ".next/tako-entry.mjs"` and `dev = ["next", "dev"]`.
- `vite` preset defaults `dev = ["vite", "dev"]` for projects using Vite as their dev server.
- Presets may declare runtime-local overrides as nested sections (`[<preset>.<runtime>]`) inside the family manifest. Only the `dev` field can be overridden — `main`, `assets`, and `name` always come from the base section. For example, `presets/javascript.toml` overrides the `vite` and `tanstack-start` dev commands for Bun (`[vite.bun]`, `[tanstack-start.bun]`) because `bunx --bun` drops fds > 2, which breaks the fd-4 readiness handshake.
- Official preset definitions live in the `tako-sh/presets` GitHub repo (overridable via the `PACKAGE_REPOSITORY_URL` env var for testing). Fetched branch manifests are cached locally for roughly one hour; on fetch failure, Tako falls back to any previously cached copy or the manifests embedded in the CLI binary. GitHub preset fetches use `GH_TOKEN` when set, falling back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- Deploy restores local JS build caches from workspace-root `.turbo/` and app-root `.next/cache/` into the temporary build workspace when present, then excludes those cache directories from the final deploy artifact.
- Runtime behavior (install commands, launch args, entrypoint resolution) lives in runtime plugins (`tako-runtime/src/plugins/`), not in presets. Explicit `start` commands bypass runtime plugin launch args and production install.
- `tako init` installs the selected runtime's SDK via the runtime package-manager `add` command: `tako.sh` for JS/Go.
- Server membership is declared per environment with `[envs.<name>].servers`.
- Storage bindings are declared per environment with `[envs.<name>].storages = { app_name = "resource_name" }`. The key is the stable app-facing binding exposed as `tako.storages.<app_name>`; the value references a top-level `[storages.<resource_name>]` S3 resource or the built-in `local` resource.
- App data backups are enabled per environment with `backup = { storage = "resource_name" }`. The resource must be a declared private S3-compatible `[storages.<resource_name>]` resource. Backup storage is not exposed as `tako.storages`; only `[envs.<env>].storages` creates SDK bindings.
- SSL certificate issuance is selected per environment with optional `ssl = "letsencrypt"` or `ssl = "cloudflare"` under `[envs.<name>]`. Omitted means `letsencrypt`. Cloudflare SSL uses Cloudflare Origin CA certificates and requires encrypted credential `ssl.cloudflare` from `tako credentials set ssl.cloudflare --env <name>` with Cloudflare Zone / SSL and Certificates / Edit permission. Let’s Encrypt exact routes need no credentials by default; when an environment has `ssl.cloudflare`, exact routes use Cloudflare DNS-01 instead of HTTP-01. Let’s Encrypt wildcard routes require the same credential because they must use DNS-01 for certificate validation.
- Tako-owned provider credentials are stored per environment in `.tako/secrets.json` by `tako credentials set <name> --env <name>`. Supported credentials are `ssl.cloudflare` for certificate operations and `postgres_url` for shared channel/workflow storage. Deploy sends provider credentials to servers as server-only runtime credentials; they are not exposed to app code. Deploy rejects expired app secrets, storage credentials, and required provider credentials before build/deploy work starts and warns when any of them expire within 30 days. Each target server verifies required Cloudflare credentials during remote prepare, before release commands, route changes, or app startup. Let’s Encrypt DNS-01 routes require a Cloudflare API token with Zone Read and DNS Write on the matching zone; both user-owned and account-owned tokens are accepted when they have the required permissions. Deploy verifies zone read access from the server's egress IP, while DNS record writes are not probed before deploy. Cloudflare SSL requires Zone / SSL and Certificates / Edit. It verifies user-owned tokens when Cloudflare's token verification endpoint supports the token format; account-owned tokens are validated by the Origin CA API when certificates are issued.
- Client source-IP handling is per environment through optional `source_ip` under `[envs.<name>]`. Omitted means automatic Cloudflare detection, then explicitly configured trusted proxy headers, then direct peer fallback.
- Top-level `[storages.<resource>]` config contains non-secret S3-compatible storage metadata. `provider` defaults to `s3`; `provider = "local"` is invalid in config. S3 resources require `bucket`, `endpoint`, and `region`; `endpoint` and optional `public_base_url` must use HTTPS. `force_path_style = true` makes SDK-generated S3 URLs use path-style bucket addressing instead of virtual-hosted bucket addressing.
- `local` is a built-in storage resource name, not a top-level `[storages.local]` table. Bind an app storage to it with `storages = { uploads = "local" }`. In `development`, a storage binding may also reference any undeclared resource name and it defaults to local storage. In deploy environments, every bound resource must be declared unless the resource name is `local`; local storage can deploy only to single-server environments.
- The same server name may be assigned to multiple non-development environments in one project. Each environment deploys to its own server-side app identity and filesystem path under `/opt/tako/apps/{app}/{env}`.
- `development` is for `tako dev`; `servers` declared there are ignored by deploy validation.
- Deployed app instances bind to `127.0.0.1` on an OS-assigned port. The SDK signals readiness to `tako-server` by writing the bound port to fd 4 (file descriptor 4) once listening. The server then routes traffic to that loopback endpoint.
- `tako dev` resolves the dev command with this priority:
  1. CLI command override after `tako dev` (for example, `tako dev vite dev`, `tako dev npm run dev`, or `tako dev -- vite dev`)
  2. `dev` in `tako.toml` (project override, e.g. `dev = ["custom", "cmd"]`)
  3. Preset `dev` command (e.g. vite preset uses `vite dev`)
  4. Runtime default: JS runtimes run through the SDK HTTP entrypoint (`bun run node_modules/tako.sh/dist/entrypoints/bun-server.mjs {main}`, or `node --experimental-strip-types node_modules/tako.sh/dist/entrypoints/node-server.mjs {main}`), and Go uses `go run .`
- `tako dev` marks an app running only after the app writes its bound loopback port to fd 4. Direct Vite dev commands (for example `vite` or `vite dev`) must use the `tako.sh/vite` plugin for fd-4 readiness; if the command looks like Vite and no readiness signal arrives, the CLI reports a Vite-specific plugin hint. Tako does not parse Vite stdout URLs as readiness.
- The dev entrypoints host the HTTP server. Workflow workers run as a **separate, scale-to-zero subprocess** managed by tako-dev-server's embedded `WorkflowManager` — same architecture as production, but `workers: 0` with a 3s idle timeout so the worker only exists while there's real work. The SDK wraps `export default function fetch()` or `export default { fetch }` into a proper HTTP server on `PORT`; worker stdout/stderr is tee'd into the CLI log stream with `scope: "worker"`.
- Process exit detection: `tako dev` polls `try_wait()` every 500ms to detect when the app process exits. On exit, the route goes idle (proxy stops forwarding) and the next HTTP request triggers a restart. A route is activated only after fd-4 readiness succeeds.
- `tako dev` resolves unpinned official preset aliases from cached or embedded preset data when available and only fetches from the `master` branch as a last resort.
- `tako deploy` resolves unpinned official preset aliases from the `master` branch on each deploy; if the refresh fails, it falls back to cached content.
- Deploy sends app vars + runtime vars to `tako-server` in the `deploy` command payload (non-secret env vars in `app.json`); secrets and storage bindings are sent separately and stored encrypted in SQLite. Native releases pass secrets and storage bindings to HTTP instances and workflow workers via fd 3 (file descriptor 3) at spawn time — the server writes JSON to a pipe and the child process reads fd 3 before any user code runs. Container releases pass the same bootstrap envelope through `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA` because the fd bootstrap pipe does not cross the container boundary in v0.
- `[build]` section has `run` (build command), `install` (optional pre-build install command), `cwd` (optional working directory relative to project root; absolute paths and `..` are rejected), plus `include`/`exclude` for artifact filtering. `[build]` is a shortcut for a single-stage `[[build_stages]]` list.
- `[build]` and `[[build_stages]]` are mutually exclusive: having both `build.run` and `[[build_stages]]` is an error. `[build].include`/`[build].exclude` cannot be used alongside `[[build_stages]]`; use per-stage `exclude` instead.
- Build stage resolution precedence (first non-empty wins): `[[build_stages]]` → `[build]` (normalized to a single stage) → runtime default. The runtime default is the runtime plugin's build command: `bun/npm/pnpm/yarn run --if-present build` for JS runtimes, and `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o app .` for Go. If a Go project has `cmd/worker/main.go`, the Go default also builds `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o worker ./cmd/worker`. When top-level `start` is set, runtime defaults are skipped; use `[build]` or `[[build_stages]]` to produce the artifact. When nothing resolves, the build phase is a no-op.
- App-level custom build stages can be declared in `tako.toml` under `[[build_stages]]` (top-level array):
  - `name` (optional display label)
  - `cwd` (optional, relative to app root; `..` is allowed for monorepo traversal but guarded against escaping the workspace root; symlink escapes outside the source root fail deploy)
  - `install` (optional command run before `run`)
  - `run` (required command)
  - `exclude` (optional array of file globs to exclude from the deploy artifact)
- Build uses a build dir approach: copies the project from source root into `.tako/build` (respecting `.gitignore`), symlinks `node_modules/` directories from the original tree, runs build commands, then archives the result without `node_modules/`.
- Build and source archives preserve symlinks as symlinks instead of following them. Directory symlinks are not expanded into the artifact, and source hashes track each symlink target so symlink changes invalidate the artifact cache.
- During `tako deploy`, source files are bundled from source root (`git` root when available, otherwise app directory).
- Deploy always force-excludes `.git/`, `.tako/`, `.env*`, and `node_modules/` from the deploy archive. Additional exclusions come from `[build].exclude` and `.gitignore`.
- After extracting a native deploy artifact, `tako-server` runs the runtime plugin's production install command (e.g. `bun install --production`) before starting instances unless the manifest has an explicit `start` command. After extracting a container deploy artifact, `tako-server` builds the configured container file with Podman instead.
- When `runtime` includes `@<version>`, deploy uses that version directly. Otherwise, runtime version resolution runs the runtime probe tool's `--version` directly, falling back to `latest`.
- Deploy saves the resolved runtime version into `app.json` (`runtime_version` field) when a runtime is selected. Runtime-less native artifact releases with explicit `start` omit `runtime_version`.
- Built target artifacts are cached locally under `.tako/artifacts/` using a deterministic cache key that includes source hash, target label, resolved preset source/commit, build commands, include/exclude patterns, asset roots, and app subdirectory.
- Cached artifacts are checksum/size verified before reuse; invalid cache entries are automatically discarded and rebuilt.
- Non-dry-run `tako deploy` acquires a project-local `.tako/deploy.lock` before local server checks/build/deploy work begins. If another deploy already holds the lock, the second CLI exits immediately with the owning PID.
- After build, deploy verifies the resolved runtime `main` file exists in the build workspace before artifact packaging; missing files fail deploy with an explicit error.
- On every deploy, local artifact cache is pruned automatically (best-effort): keep the 90 most recent target artifacts (`{version}.tar.zst` under `.tako/artifacts/` and its per-target subdirectories) and remove orphan target metadata files.
- Artifact include patterns are resolved in this order:
  - `build.include` (if set)
  - fallback `**/*`
- Artifact exclude patterns: `[build].exclude` entries.
- Asset roots are preset `assets` plus top-level `assets` (deduplicated), merged into app `public/` after build in listed order (later entries overwrite earlier ones).

**Instance behavior:**

- Desired instances are runtime app state stored on each server, not `tako.toml` config.
- New app deploys start with desired instances `1` on each server. The first request after deploy hits a hot instance — no cold start. Opt into scale-to-zero with `tako scale 0 --env <environment>` from a project directory, or `tako scale 0 --server <server> --app <app>/<env>` outside one.
- `tako scale` changes the desired instance count per targeted server, and that value persists across server restarts, deploys, and rollbacks.
- Each app has a server-side maximum instance count. New deploys default that maximum to two app instances per available CPU. Explicit scale or deploy requests above the effective server maximum fail instead of silently capping. During server restore, invalid persisted counts above the maximum are clamped and logged so startup stays safe.
- Desired instances `0`: On-demand with scale-to-zero. Deploy keeps one warm instance running so the app is immediately reachable after deploy. Instances are stopped after idle timeout.
  - Once scaled to zero, the next request triggers a cold start and waits for readiness up to startup timeout (default 30 seconds). If no healthy instance is ready before timeout, proxy returns `504 Gateway Timeout` with a generic body.
  - If cold start setup fails before readiness, proxy returns `502 Bad Gateway` with a generic body.
  - Startup timeout diagnostics are recorded in the app log stream, including captured startup stdout/stderr when the process produced output before readiness.
  - While a cold start is already in progress, requests are queued up to 1000 waiters per app (default). If the queue is full, proxy returns `503 Service Unavailable` with a generic body.
  - If warm-instance startup fails during deploy, deploy fails.
- Desired instances `N` (`N > 0`): keep at least `N` instances running on that server.
- `idle_timeout`: Applies per-instance (default 300s / 5 minutes)
- Instances are not stopped while serving in-flight requests.
- Explicit scale-down drains in-flight requests first, then stops excess instances.

### config.toml (Global User Config)

Global user-level settings and server inventory. Stored in the platform config directory (`~/Library/Application Support/tako/` on macOS, `~/.config/tako/` on Linux). NOT in the project.

```toml
[[servers]]
name = "la"
host = "1.2.3.4"
port = 22                 # Optional, defaults to 22
http_port = 80            # Optional public HTTP port, defaults to 80
https_port = 443          # Optional public HTTPS port, defaults to 443
arch = "x86_64"
libc = "glibc"

[[servers]]
name = "nyc"
host = "5.6.7.8"
arch = "aarch64"
libc = "musl"
```

`[[servers]]` entries are managed by `tako servers add/rm/ls`. All names and hosts must be globally unique.
Detected server build target metadata (`arch`, `libc`) and public proxy ports (`http_port`, `https_port`) are stored directly in each `[[servers]]` entry.

**SSH authentication:**

- `tako` authenticates using local SSH keys from `~/.ssh` (common filenames like `id_ed25519`, `id_rsa`, etc.).
- A `[[servers]]` entry can pin a specific private key with `key_path` (set via `tako servers add --ssh-key {path}` or the add-server wizard). When set, connections to that server use only that key — default keys and `ssh-agent` are not tried. A leading `~` is expanded.
- If a key file is passphrase-protected, `tako` will prompt for the passphrase when running interactively. Pass `--ssh-passphrase {passphrase}` for one-line commands and non-interactive runs.
- If no suitable key files are found or usable, `tako` falls back to `ssh-agent` via `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (when available).

- `tako dev` uses a fixed local HTTPS listen port (`47831`).
- On macOS, `tako dev` uses a dedicated loopback alias (`127.77.0.1`) plus a launchd-managed dev proxy so public URLs stay on default ports (`:443` for HTTPS, `:80` for HTTP redirect).
- On Linux, `tako dev` uses the same loopback alias (`127.77.0.1`) with iptables redirect rules (443→47831, 80→47830, 53→53535) to achieve portless URLs without a proxy binary. One-time `sudo` sets up the rules, a systemd oneshot service persists them across reboots. On NixOS, a `configuration.nix` snippet is printed instead of imperative setup.

CLI prompt history is stored separately at `history.toml` (not in `config.toml`).

### .tako/secrets.json (Project - Encrypted)

Per-environment encrypted secrets (JSON format, AES-256-GCM encryption):

```json
{
  "production": {
    "key_id": "0123456789abcdef",
    "backup_keys": [
      {
        "id": "backup-key-0123456789abcdef",
        "value": "encrypted_value"
      }
    ],
    "app": {
      "DATABASE_URL": {
        "value": "encrypted_value",
        "expires_on": "2027-01-01"
      },
      "API_KEY": {
        "value": "encrypted_value"
      }
    },
    "storages": {
      "prod_uploads": {
        "access_key_id": {
          "value": "encrypted_value",
          "expires_on": "2027-01-01"
        },
        "secret_access_key": {
          "value": "encrypted_value",
          "expires_on": "2027-01-01"
        }
      }
    },
    "credentials": {
      "ssl.cloudflare": {
        "value": "encrypted_value",
        "expires_on": "2027-01-01"
      }
    }
  },
  "staging": {
    "key_id": "fedcba9876543210",
    "app": {
      "DATABASE_URL": {
        "value": "encrypted_value_different"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each environment has a `key_id` (16 hex characters), optional `backup_keys`, an `app` map for app secrets, an optional `storages` map for encrypted storage credentials keyed by storage resource name, and an optional `credentials` map for encrypted provider credentials keyed by credential name. App secret names, backup key ids, storage resource names, and credential names are plaintext. Each encrypted secret field stores a `value` and may store `expires_on`; `value` is encrypted with AES-256-GCM, while `expires_on` is plaintext date metadata. Backup key `value` fields are encrypted 32-byte backup encryption keys protected by the environment key. Expiry values are dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`); `in N days` is normalized to the UTC date N days from now. Leaving expiry blank, omitting `--expires-on`, or passing `never` leaves `expires_on` out of `.tako/secrets.json`.

Deploy validates expiry before build/deploy work starts. Expired app secrets, expired S3 storage credentials used by the target environment, and expired provider credentials required by the selected certificate provider fail deployment with an update command. Credentials that expire within 30 days produce a deployment warning but do not block the deploy. Required Cloudflare credentials are checked by each target server during remote prepare: Let’s Encrypt DNS-01 routes verify Cloudflare API token zone read access from the server's egress IP and require DNS Write for certificate issuance, while Cloudflare SSL verifies user-owned token status when supported by Cloudflare's verification endpoint.

`tako init` ensures the app's `.tako/` directory stays ignored while `.tako/secrets.json` remains trackable:

- inside a git repo, it updates the repo root `.gitignore` with app-relative rules
- outside a git repo, it creates or updates `.gitignore` in the app directory

Encryption keys are stored outside the project:

- By default, environment-specific keys are cached under Tako's data directory as `keys/{key_id}`, where `key_id` is the environment key id stored in `.tako/secrets.json`.
- On macOS, interactive key creation and key import offer `Use iCloud Keychain?`. Choosing yes stores and reads the key directly from the signed `Tako.app` CLI using a synchronizable Keychain item. The installer symlinks `tako` to `Tako.app/Contents/MacOS/tako`; no helper process or socket is used. If a local key file already exists and iCloud Keychain is unavailable during a read, Tako uses the local key file. If the signed app entitlement is unavailable while saving a key to iCloud Keychain, Tako fails with `iCloud Keychain requires the signed Tako app. Reinstall Tako and try again.` and does not write a local key file or update `.tako/secrets.json`.

When the first secret is set for an environment, Tako generates a random environment key. Keys are shared with other machines via `tako secrets key export` and `tako secrets key import`. Teams that prefer a memorized shared secret can initialize an environment key with `tako secrets key import --passphrase --env {environment}` before setting secrets.

### Storage Configuration And Credentials

Storage bindings are split between `tako.toml` and `.tako/secrets.json`. `tako.toml` stores app-facing binding names and non-secret provider metadata. `.tako/secrets.json` stores only encrypted S3 credentials under each environment's `storages` map. There is no separate `.tako/storages.json` file.

```toml
[envs.production]
route = "app.example.com"
servers = ["la"]
storages = { uploads = "prod_uploads" }

[storages.prod_uploads]
provider = "s3"
bucket = "app-uploads"
endpoint = "https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
region = "auto"
force_path_style = false
public_base_url = "https://cdn.example.com/uploads"
```

Storage binding and S3 resource names may contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. The resource name `local` is built in and must not be declared under `[storages]`; bind to it directly with `storages = { uploads = "local" }`. For S3 resources, `force_path_style = true` makes SDK-generated URLs use path-style bucket addressing. `tako storages add` prompts for access credentials and optionally when they expire; `--expires-on` can provide the expiry directly. Deploy fails before build/deploy work starts if the selected environment's S3 credentials are expired and warns when they expire within 30 days. When credentials are current or expiry is unknown, deploy decrypts them locally, combines them with the selected `tako.toml` resource metadata, sends the runtime bindings over the signed management path, and `tako-server` stores the resulting bindings encrypted in server SQLite. Fresh native app and worker processes receive bindings through the fd 3 bootstrap envelope as `storages`; fresh container app processes receive the same envelope through `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`.

`tako storages credentials <resource> --env <environment>` sets or rotates encrypted S3 credentials for a declared top-level storage resource without adding an app binding. This is the recommended setup path for backup-only storage resources. The same S3 bucket may be used for app storage and backups; backup objects are automatically written under Tako's reserved `_tako/backups/` prefix.

### App Data Backups

Backups are opt-in per environment:

```toml
[envs.production]
route = "app.example.com"
servers = ["la", "nyc"]
backup = { storage = "r2" }

[storages.r2]
provider = "s3"
bucket = "app-data"
endpoint = "https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
region = "auto"
```

Backup storage reuses declared `[storages.<resource>]` metadata and `.tako/secrets.json` S3 credentials. It must be S3-compatible and private: `provider = "local"` and `public_base_url` are rejected. A backup-only resource can share a bucket with app storage because Tako writes backups under `_tako/backups/{app}/{env}/{server}/`. The `{server}` segment comes from the deployed server identity/name so multiple servers in one environment do not overwrite each other's archives.

Backup archives preserve symlinks as symlinks, then encrypt the archive before upload with AES-256-GCM. When backups are enabled, `tako deploy` and `tako backups now` create `backup_keys` for the environment if none exist. The keys are encrypted in `.tako/secrets.json` with the existing environment key; users still export/import only the environment key. The last `backup_keys` entry is used for new backups. Each backup manifest records its `backup_key_id`, so older backups can still be restored while their key remains in `.tako/secrets.json` and is synced to the server.

When enabled, Tako backs up durable per-app state under `{data_dir}/apps/{app}/{env}/data/`:

- `app/` — app-owned data exposed as `TAKO_DATA_DIR`
- `tako/workflows.sqlite` — Tako-owned durable workflow queue/state

Workflow storage uses local SQLite at `{data_dir}/apps/{app}/{env}/data/tako/workflows.sqlite` unless the environment has credential `postgres_url`, in which case the server uses Postgres schema `tako_workflows` keyed by deployed app id. If a deployed environment targets more than one server and the JS app has `<app_root>/workflows/`, deploy fails before build/deploy work starts unless `postgres_url` is set or every workflow definition opts into per-server local execution with `defineWorkflow(..., { local: true, ... })`. If a Go app has `cmd/worker/main.go` and targets more than one server, deploy requires `postgres_url` because Go workflows do not have a source-level local-only annotation. Local workflows use each server's own local queue and cron schedule set; cron runs once per server and enqueued work is not globally deduplicated.

Channel replay uses local SQLite at `{data_dir}/apps/{app}/{env}/data/tako/channels.sqlite` unless the environment has credential `postgres_url`, in which case the server uses Postgres schema `tako_channels` keyed by deployed app id. Multi-server channel deploys require `postgres_url` because a publish on one server must be visible to subscribers and reconnecting clients on every server. Channel messages are inserted durably before fanout; production subscribers poll the selected replay store for new retained rows.

Tako does not back up transient local SQLite stores under `tako/` such as channel replay (`channels.sqlite`) and SDK cache (`cache.sqlite`), including their SQLite companion files. Channel replay is a bounded reconnect buffer, not canonical app history, and cache entries are recomputable, so restored apps start with empty channel replay and cache storage. SQLite files that are included in backups are snapshotted with SQLite's online `VACUUM INTO` mechanism before archiving, and `-wal`/`-shm` companion files are not included separately. Archives are compressed as `tar.zst`, encrypted before upload, and stored with a SHA-256 manifest for the encrypted object plus a remote JSON index. Retention defaults to 30 days. The server creates a backup after a successful deploy and then runs due backups roughly every 24 hours while `tako-server` is running. Backup failures after deploy are reported in the finalize response/logs but do not roll back an otherwise successful deploy.

### SSL Provider Configuration And Credentials

Public route certificates use Let’s Encrypt by default. Exact Let’s Encrypt routes do not need provider credentials by default and use HTTP-01. If the environment has credential `ssl.cloudflare`, exact routes use Cloudflare DNS-01 instead. Let’s Encrypt wildcard routes always use Cloudflare DNS-01 and require `ssl.cloudflare`.

```toml
[envs.production]
route = "*.example.com"
servers = ["la"]
ssl = "letsencrypt"
source_ip = "direct"
```

Set up Let’s Encrypt wildcard certificate credentials with:

```bash
tako credentials set ssl.cloudflare --env production
```

The command prompts for a Cloudflare API token and optionally asks when the token expires. `--expires-on` can provide the expiry directly. The token is encrypted in `.tako/secrets.json` under the selected environment's `credentials` object as `ssl.cloudflare`. For Let’s Encrypt DNS-01, use a Cloudflare user or account API token with Zone Read and DNS Write for the matching Cloudflare zone, and include each target server's egress IP in any token IP restriction. Deploy validates that Let’s Encrypt wildcard routes have an unexpired credential when expiry is known, warns when the credential expires within 30 days, decrypts the selected environment's token locally, sends the SSL binding during remote prepare, verifies Cloudflare zone read access from the target server, and `tako-server` stores it encrypted in server SQLite for that deployed app after the final deploy command starts. Exact Let’s Encrypt routes use the same DNS-01 path when this credential is present.

Cloudflare DNS-01 is only used to prove domain control for Let’s Encrypt certificates. It does not require Cloudflare proxy mode. For wildcard second-level subdomains such as `*.app.example.com`, use DNS-only/direct records that point at the Tako server so `tako-server` terminates TLS itself.

Set `ssl = "cloudflare"` on an environment to use Cloudflare Origin CA certificates instead:

```toml
[envs.production]
route = "app.example.com"
servers = ["la"]
ssl = "cloudflare"
source_ip = "cloudflare-proxy"
```

Set up the Cloudflare provider credential with:

```bash
tako credentials set ssl.cloudflare --env production
```

The command stores the encrypted Cloudflare API token plus optional `expires_on` metadata in `.tako/secrets.json` under that environment's `credentials` object. Use a Cloudflare user or account API token with Zone / SSL and Certificates / Edit for the matching zone. Deploy validates provider credential expiry locally, decrypts the token locally, sends the SSL binding during remote prepare for server-side validation, and `tako-server` stores it encrypted in server SQLite for that deployed app after the final deploy command starts. User-owned Cloudflare tokens are checked with Cloudflare's token verification endpoint when supported; account-owned tokens are accepted and validated by Origin CA API calls when certificates are issued.

Cloudflare SSL issues Origin CA certificates through Cloudflare's Origin CA API. These certificates are intended for Cloudflare-proxied traffic; direct browser connections to the origin will not trust them. Cloudflare SSL can issue wildcard route certificates without DNS-01 credentials.

### Source IP Configuration

`[envs.<env>].source_ip` controls how Tako derives the client IP that is used for per-IP rate limits and upstream `X-Forwarded-For`.

```toml
[envs.production]
route = "app.example.com"
servers = ["la"]
source_ip = "direct"
```

Allowed values:

- Omitted or `"auto"`: if the direct peer IP belongs to Cloudflare and `CF-Connecting-IP` is present, use that header; otherwise, if server `trusted_proxy.client_ip_headers` is configured and the peer IP is in `trusted_proxy.trusted_cidrs`, use the first configured trusted header that contains a valid client IP; otherwise use the direct peer IP.
- `"direct"`: always use the direct peer IP.
- `"cloudflare-proxy"`: strict Cloudflare mode; requests must come from Cloudflare IP ranges and include a valid `CF-Connecting-IP` header. Other requests are rejected with `403 Forbidden`.
- `"trusted-proxy"`: strict generic proxy mode for nginx, HAProxy, Caddy, Traefik, and similar front proxies. Requests must come from loopback or from a CIDR listed in server `trusted_proxy.trusted_cidrs`, and must include a valid client IP in `X-Forwarded-For` or `Forwarded` unless the server config sets an explicit `trusted_proxy.client_ip_headers` list. Other requests are rejected with `403 Forbidden`.

Generated `tako.toml` files omit `source_ip` by default. `tako-server` keeps Cloudflare IP ranges in memory, starts from a bundled fallback list, overlays a valid last-known-good cache from the server data directory, and refreshes the list every 24 hours while running when any route uses `source_ip = "auto"` or `source_ip = "cloudflare-proxy"`. Successful refreshes are written back to disk.

## Tako CLI Commands

### Installation and upgrades

Install the CLI on your local machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tako.sh/install.sh | sh
```

The hosted installer installs `tako`, `tako-dev-server`, and `tako-dev-proxy` from the same archive and requires a valid SHA-256 checksum before extraction. Official macOS CLI builds support Apple Silicon only. On macOS, the installer installs `Tako.app`, verifies the signed app and helper binaries, symlinks `tako` to the signed CLI inside the app bundle, and installs libvips with Homebrew when Homebrew is available.

Upgrade local CLI:

```bash
tako upgrade
```

`tako upgrade` upgrades only the local CLI installation and requires a valid SHA-256 checksum before extraction.
On macOS, `tako upgrade` supports Apple Silicon only and preserves the installer layout: it installs the verified `Tako.app` bundle atomically, keeps `tako` as a symlink to `Tako.app/Contents/MacOS/tako`, and installs `tako-dev-server` and `tako-dev-proxy` next to that symlink.

Rolling release model:

- `latest` is a single moving GitHub release updated by CI on each `master` push. There are no versioned releases and no stable/canary distinction; every build is a rolling build while Tako's protocol is v0.
- CLI and server artifacts report `<base>-<sha7>` in `--version` output, where `<base>` is the package version (always `0.0.0`) and `<sha7>` is the 7-character source commit.
- The npm-published SDK (`tako.sh`) uses `0.0.0-<sha7>` version strings and is published under the `latest` dist-tag on every push.
- GitHub-backed update checks and release downloads use `GH_TOKEN` when set, falling back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Tokens are sent only as `Authorization: Bearer ...` request headers, not in URLs.

### Global options

- `--version`: Print version and exit (format: `<base>-<sha7>`).
- `-v, --verbose`: Show verbose output as an append-only execution transcript with timestamps and log levels.
- `--ci`: Deterministic non-interactive output (no colors, no spinners, no prompts). Can be combined with `--verbose`.
- `--json`: Emit structured JSON on stdout. This is a global flag accepted before or after any
  subcommand. JSON mode implies CI-style non-interactive rendering for progress, prompts, and
  diagnostics.
- `--dry-run`: Show what would happen without performing any side effects. Skips server connections, file uploads, config writes, and remote commands. Prints `⏭ ... (dry run)` for each skipped action. Production deploy confirmation is auto-skipped. Supported by: `deploy`, `servers add`, `servers remove`, `delete`, and side-effecting backup commands (`backups now`, `backups download`, `backups restore`).
- `-c, --config {config}`: Use an explicit app config file instead of `./tako.toml`. If the provided path does not end with `.toml`, Tako appends it automatically. App-scoped commands treat the selected file's parent directory as the project directory. This allows multiple config files in one folder.
- `--ssh-passphrase {passphrase}`: Use the provided passphrase for encrypted local SSH private keys during SSH authentication and signed remote-management requests.

CLI output modes:

- **Normal mode** (default): Concise interactive UX with rich prompts and inline progress rendering. Commands that already know their plan may render a persistent task tree that shows waiting work up front (`○` with `...` labels), updates running tasks in place, keeps completed tasks visible, and may render reporter-specific error lines under failed task rows.
- **Verbose mode** (`--verbose`): Append-only execution transcript. Each line: `HH:MM:SS LEVEL message`. It only prints work as it starts or finishes; upcoming tasks are not pre-rendered. Prompts render as transcript-style (still interactive). DEBUG-level messages are shown.
- **CI mode** (`--ci`): No ANSI colors, no spinners, no interactive prompts. It stays transcript-style and emits only current work plus final results. If a required prompt value is missing, fails with an actionable error message suggesting CLI flags or config.
- **JSON mode** (`--json`): Same non-interactive rendering as CI for progress and diagnostics,
  with one machine-readable command result on stdout for finite commands. Progress, trace,
  warning, and error text stays on stderr. Commands with command-specific data include that data
  in the final result; commands without a specialized schema use `{ "ok": true, "command":
"<command>" }`. Command failures print `{ "ok": false, "error": { "message": "<message>" } }`
  on stdout and the human-readable error on stderr.
- **CI + Verbose** (`--ci --verbose`): Detailed append-only transcript with no colors or timestamps.
- On `Ctrl-C`, Tako clears any active prompt or spinner it controls, leaves one blank line, prints `Operation cancelled`, and exits with code 130. Active task-tree rows keep their current visual state; interruption does not rewrite in-progress rows as cancelled.

All status/progress/log output goes to stderr. Only actual command results (URLs, machine-readable data) go to stdout.
`tako logs --tail --json` is a streaming exception: it emits one structured log event per stdout
line until interrupted instead of a final result object. `tako run` is also an exception: child
stdout stays untouched and no JSON result object is appended.

Config selection is global for app-scoped commands:

- default: `./tako.toml`
- override: `-c path/to/config` (recommended shorthand; `.toml` suffix is optional)
- project directory: parent directory of the selected config file

App-scoped commands that honor `-c/--config`: `init`, `dev`, `run`, `logs`, `deploy`, `releases`,
`backups`, `delete`, `secrets`, `storages`, `generate`, and `scale` when it is using project context.

### tako init

Create `tako.toml` template with helpful comments.

```bash
tako init
```

Template behavior:

- Leaves only minimal starter options uncommented:
  - `name`
  - `[envs.production].route`
  - top-level `runtime` (including a version pin from the locally-installed runtime via `<runtime> --version`)
  - top-level `preset` only when a non-base preset is selected (for base adapter presets and custom mode, it remains commented/unset)
- Updates `.gitignore` so the app's `.tako/*` stays ignored while `.tako/secrets.json` remains trackable (repo-root `.gitignore` when inside git, app-local `.gitignore` otherwise)
- Includes commented examples/explanations for supported `tako.toml` options:
  - `name`, `main`, top-level `runtime`/`preset`/`assets`/`dev`, `[build]` (`run`, `install`, `cwd`, `include`, `exclude`), and `[[build_stages]]` (with per-stage `cwd` and `exclude`)
  - `[vars]`
  - `[vars.<env>]`
  - `[envs.<env>]` route declarations (`route`/`routes`), server membership (`servers`), and idle scaling policy (`idle_timeout`)
- Includes a docs link to `https://tako.sh/docs/tako-toml`.
- Writes the selected config file (default `./tako.toml`).
- Prompts for required app `name` (default from selected-config parent directory-derived app name).
- Prompts for required production route (`[envs.production].route`) with default `{name}.example.com`.
- If the production route is a wildcard route, prompts to set up Cloudflare DNS for wildcard HTTPS. When accepted, init optionally asks when the token expires and encrypts the Cloudflare API token in `.tako/secrets.json` under the production environment's `credentials` object as `ssl.cloudflare`.
- Detects adapter (`bun`, `node`, `go`, fallback `unknown`) and prompts for runtime selection.
- For JS runtimes, prompts for `app_root` after runtime selection. The default is `src` for new projects, `src` or `app` when existing Tako JS files live there, and `.` when existing `tako.d.ts`, legacy `tako.gen.ts`, `channels/`, or `workflows/` live next to `tako.toml`. The generated config omits `app_root` when the selected root is the default `src`, and writes it only for non-default roots.
- After generating `tako.toml`, init installs the SDK package via the selected runtime's package-manager `add` command (for JS: `bun add tako.sh`, etc.; for Go: `go get tako.sh`).
- In interactive mode, init fetches runtime-family preset names from official family manifest files (`presets/<language>.toml`) and shows `Fetching presets...` while loading.
- For built-in base adapters, init defaults to:
  - Bun: `bun`
  - Node: `node`
  - Go: `go`
- Init prints the full "Detected" summary block only in verbose mode; default output keeps setup concise and action-oriented.
- If no family presets are available after fetch, init skips preset selection and uses the runtime base preset.
- When "custom preset reference" is selected, init leaves top-level `preset` unset (commented) but still writes top-level `runtime`.
- For `main`, init behavior is:
  - if adapter inference finds an entrypoint and it differs from preset default `main`, write it as top-level `main`;
  - if inferred `main` matches preset default (or preset default exists and no inference is available), omit top-level `main`;
  - prompt only when neither adapter inference nor preset default `main` is available.

If the selected config file already exists:

- Interactive terminal: `tako init` asks for overwrite confirmation.
- Non-interactive terminal: skips overwrite, leaves the existing file untouched, and prints `Operation cancelled`.

### tako help

Show all commands with brief descriptions.

### tako version

Show version information (same as `--version` flag).

### tako generate

Refresh generated files for the current project: `tako.d.ts` for JS/TS apps (project-specific type augmentation for `tako.sh`) and `tako_secrets.go` for Go apps. `tako gen` and `tako g` are aliases. For JS/TS projects, `tako generate` keeps an existing `tako.d.ts` in `app/`, `src/`, or the project root. When creating the file for the first time, it uses an existing legacy `tako.gen.ts` location when present, otherwise `app/`, then `src/`, then the project root. The JS/TS declaration file includes user-defined variable names from `[vars]` and `[vars.<env>]` on `process.env` and `import.meta.env`, typed as strings. Legacy `tako.gen.ts` files are removed on regeneration. If a JS/TS project already has `<app_root>/channels/` or `<app_root>/workflows/` directories, `tako generate` also scaffolds `demo.ts` in empty dirs and adds missing default `defineChannel(...)` or `defineWorkflow(...)` exports to existing definition files that have no default export yet. Generated channel stubs use the file stem as the initial wire name, but `tako generate` does not rewrite existing explicit names.

### tako run

```bash
tako run [--env {environment}] {script-file} [args...]
tako run [--env {environment}] --eval {code} [-- args...]
tako run [--env {environment}] -- {command...}
```

Run a one-off command locally with Tako project context. `--env` defaults to `development`.

If the first positional argument is a script extension supported by the selected runtime, Tako expands it through that runtime's local-run rule and appends remaining args. Bun runs JS/TS scripts with `bun {script}`, Node runs JS scripts with `node {script}` and TS scripts with `node --experimental-strip-types {script}`, and Go runs `.go` files with `go run {script}`. `--eval` writes inline source to a temporary runtime-local script file and runs it through the runtime's inline rule; JS runtimes support inline TypeScript source. Runtimes without an inline rule reject `--eval`. Unknown extensions are treated as explicit commands, and `-- {command...}` is the exact-command escape hatch for tools such as `cargo run`, `sh`, or custom binaries.

The child process runs with cwd set to the selected config file's parent directory. It receives merged `[vars]` + `[vars.<env>]`, derived `ENV=<env>`, `TAKO_BUILD=local`, `TAKO_DATA_DIR=<project>/.tako/data/app`, and runtime adapter defaults. JS runtimes also receive `TAKO_APP_ROOT`; non-development environments use production runtime defaults (`NODE_ENV=production`, `BUN_ENV=production` for Bun).

Tako decrypts local app secrets for the selected environment when the local key is available, builds the standard bootstrap envelope, and passes it through `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`. SDK-aware scripts read secrets and storage bindings through the same app SDK surfaces; JS/TS scripts can import `tako` and use `tako.secrets` and `tako.storages`. Secrets are not exposed as process env vars.

The command is local-only in v0: it does not run on deployment servers and does not fan out to all servers in an environment. Child stdout/stderr are inherited, `tako run` does not print a success line or JSON result object, and a non-zero child exit exits with the child's status code.

### tako upgrade

Upgrade the local `tako` CLI binary to the latest available build.

CLI upgrade strategy:

- Homebrew install detection: runs `brew upgrade tako`
- Default/fallback: downloads the hosted CLI archive and installs it directly with the same layout as `scripts/install-tako.sh`

### tako dev [--variant {variant}] [--tunnel] [command...]

Start (or connect to) a local development session for the current app, backed by a persistent dev daemon.

- `--variant` (alias `--var`) runs a DNS variant of the app (e.g. `--variant foo` → `myapp-foo.test`).
- `--tunnel` starts the session with a temporary public tunnel URL enabled.
- `command...` overrides the configured dev command for this run. For example, `tako dev vite dev` wraps `vite dev` in the Tako dev lifecycle. Use `tako dev -- <command...>` when the child command conflicts with a Tako dev subcommand such as `stop` or `list`, or when the child command starts with a flag.
- `tako dev` is a **client**: it ensures `tako-dev-server` is running, then registers the selected config file with the daemon.
  - On macOS, `tako dev` also ensures the socket-activated `tako-dev-proxy` helper is installed and loaded for loopback-only `:80/:443` ingress.
  - On Linux, `tako dev` ensures iptables redirect rules and a loopback alias (`127.77.0.1`) are configured for portless HTTPS. On NixOS, it prints a `configuration.nix` snippet instead of imperative setup.
  - When running from a source checkout, `tako dev` prefers the repo-local `target/debug|release/tako-dev-server` binary.
  - When running from a source checkout on macOS, `tako dev` can also build the repo-local `tako-dev-proxy` binary when the helper needs installation or repair.
  - If no local daemon binary exists, `tako dev` falls back to `tako-dev-server` on `PATH`.
  - If that fallback binary is missing:
    - source checkout flow reports a build hint (`cargo build -p tako-cli --bin tako-dev-server`)
    - installed CLI flow reports a reinstall hint (`curl -fsSL https://tako.sh/install.sh | sh`)
  - If daemon startup fails, `tako dev` reports the last lines from `{TAKO_HOME}/dev-server.log`.
  - `tako dev` waits up to ~15 seconds for the daemon socket after spawn before reporting startup failure.
  - The daemon performs an upfront bind-availability check for its HTTPS listen address and exits immediately with an explicit error when that address is unavailable.
- `tako dev` **registers** the app with the daemon (selected config path is the unique key, state is persisted in SQLite at `{TAKO_HOME}/dev-server.sqlite`).
- App statuses: `running` (actively serving), `idle` (process stopped, routes retained for wake-on-request), `stopped` (unregistered, routes removed).
- The app starts immediately when `tako dev` starts (1 local instance) and transitions to idle after 30 minutes of no attached CLI clients.
  - After an idle transition, the next HTTP request triggers wake-on-request: the daemon spawns the app process and routes the request once the app is healthy.
  - Idle shutdown is suppressed while there are in-flight requests.
  - When `Ctrl+c` is pressed, Tako unregisters the app (sets status to stopped, removes routes, and stops the app runtime).
  - Pressing `b` (background) hands the running process off to the daemon and exits the CLI. The daemon monitors the process and keeps routes active.
  - Running `tako dev` again with the same selected config file attaches to the existing session if the app is running or idle.
  - Dev logs are written to a shared per-app/per-config stream at `{TAKO_HOME}/dev/logs/{app}-{hash}.jsonl`.
  - Dev channel replay is process-local: the daemon keeps one in-memory replay store per registered app and resets it when `tako-dev-server` restarts.
  - Each persisted log record stores a single `timestamp` token (`hh:mm:ss`) instead of split hour/minute/second fields.
  - When a new owning session starts, Tako truncates that shared stream before writing fresh logs for the new session.
  - Attached clients replay the existing file contents, then follow new lines from the same stream.
  - App lifecycle state (`starting`, `running`, `stopped`, app PID, and startup errors) is persisted to the same shared stream, so attached sessions reconstruct the same status/CPU/RAM view as the owning session.
  - The CLI prints `App started` once the daemon has confirmed the app is live. Active routes are shown in the status footer, not in this message.
- The daemon supports **multiple concurrent apps** and maintains hostname-based routing for `*.test` (and `*.tako.test` as a fallback).
  - When LAN mode is enabled from the interactive UI (`l`), the same registered dev routes are also reachable via `.local` aliases. Hostnames are rewritten only at the suffix, so subdomains, wildcard hosts, and path-prefixed routes keep the same shape.
    - Concrete hostnames are advertised to the LAN via mDNS (Bonjour on macOS, Avahi on Linux) so phones and tablets resolve them by name.
    - Wildcard routes (e.g. `*.app.test`) cannot be advertised via mDNS — the protocol only supports concrete records. They still match at the proxy, so devices with their own DNS server for the subdomain can reach them, but plain mDNS clients (phones) cannot. Tako surfaces a warning under the LAN mode route list pointing to the wildcard routes and suggesting an explicit subdomain route (e.g. `api.app.test`) as the fix.
  - Tunnel mode creates a temporary public HTTPS URL through the Tako tunnel service and forwards it to the app's local dev route. The public hostname uses `{app}-{id}.tako.website`; `{id}` is derived from the app name and the local Tako Identity public key, so the same app gets the same URL when the same identity is available. On macOS, Tako tries to store the identity in iCloud Keychain and falls back to local storage when synced Keychain access is unavailable. Other platforms use local identity storage. The tunnel service issues a nonce and only creates the tunnel after the client signs that nonce with the Tako Identity key, so no login or namespace claim is required.
    - `tako dev --tunnel` enables tunnel mode during startup.
    - Pressing `t` in the interactive UI toggles tunnel mode for the current app.
    - Starting a tunnel for the same app and identity replaces any previous active tunnel for that URL.
    - One Tako Identity can have up to five active tunnel URLs connected at the same time. Reconnecting or replacing the same app URL does not consume another slot. Starting a sixth active tunnel accepts the new tunnel and closes the oldest active tunnel for that identity; the closed client turns tunnel mode off and prints why it was closed.
    - Tunnel URLs do not have a fixed session TTL. Tunnel mode stays enabled until the user turns it off or the app is unregistered. If the local tunnel connection is lost, Tako keeps the URL reserved, marks the tunnel as reconnecting, retries with bounded exponential backoff, and prints a log line when reconnecting starts and when the tunnel reconnects. When a tunnel turns off, Tako prints a log line explaining whether it was turned off by the user, stopped with the app, or closed by the service.
    - Inactive or disconnected tunnel URLs return a Tako-styled HTML error page for browser requests, JSON for clients that accept `application/json`, and plain text for other clients.
- When running in an interactive terminal, `tako dev` prints a branded header (logo + version + app info) once at startup, then streams logs and status updates directly to stdout.
  - Native terminal features (scrollback, search, copy/paste, clickable links) are preserved — no alternate screen is used.
  - Log levels are `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL`; the level token is colorized using pastel colors (electric blue, green, yellow, red, and purple respectively).
  - The timestamp token (`hh:mm:ss`) is rendered in a muted color.
  - Log lines are prefixed as `hh:mm:ss LEVEL [scope] message`.
    - Common scopes: `tako` (local dev daemon) and `app` (the app process).
    - For app-process output, Tako infers the level from leading tokens like `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`/`WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL` (including bracketed forms such as `[DEBUG]`), and maps `TRACE` to `DEBUG`.
  - App lifecycle state changes (starting, stopped, errors) are printed inline as `── {status} ──` lines in the log stream.
  - The status panel always shows `routes`, `lan`, and `tunnel` rows. `routes` lists local HTTPS routes. `lan` shows an enable hint when off, an active URL with a disable hint when on, or a retry hint after failure. `tunnel` shows an enable hint when off, a starting/failed state while toggling, an active URL with a disable hint when on, and a reconnecting state with the same URL during transient tunnel service disconnects.
  - When LAN mode is enabled, Tako prints a QR block for installing the local CA certificate on another device. When tunnel mode is enabled, Tako prints a short public URL block for visibility. When tunnel mode reconnects or turns off, Tako prints a `tako` log line with the reconnect status or close reason.
  - Keyboard shortcuts (interactive terminal only):
    - `r` restart the app runtime (HTTP app process plus workflow workers when configured)
    - `l` toggle LAN mode (expose the same routes via `.local` aliases on the local network)
    - `t` toggle tunnel mode (temporary public URL)
    - `b` background the app (hand off to daemon, CLI exits)
    - `Ctrl+c` stop the app and quit
  - When stdout is not a terminal (piped or redirected), `tako dev` falls back to plain `println`-style output with no color or raw mode.
  - `tako dev` watches `tako.toml`, `.tako/secrets.json`, `<app_root>/channels/`, `<app_root>/workflows/`, and parent directories that can contain `tako.d.ts` (`app/`, `src/`, and the project root) so the generated JS/TS declaration file is recreated if removed or edited.
  - It restarts the app runtime when effective dev environment variables, secrets, channel definitions, or workflow definitions change. Dev channel replay stays in the daemon's in-memory store across app-runtime restarts and resets only when `tako-dev-server` restarts.
  - It updates dev routing without restarting when `[envs.development].route(s)` changes.
- Source hot-reload is runtime-driven (e.g. Bun watch/dev scripts); Tako does not watch arbitrary source files for auto-restart.
- HTTPS is terminated by the local dev daemon using certificates issued by the local CA (SNI-based cert selection).
- `tako dev` ensures daemon TLS files exist at `{TAKO_HOME}/certs/fullchain.pem` and `{TAKO_HOME}/certs/privkey.pem` before spawning the daemon.
  - The daemon reuses existing TLS files when present.
- `tako dev` listens on `127.0.0.1:47831` in HTTPS mode.
- When `[envs.development].routes` is not configured, Tako registers `https://{app}.test:47831/` on non-macOS and `https://{app}.test/` on macOS. When the user configures explicit `.test`/`.tako.test` routes, those managed dev routes replace the default entirely — the default `{app}.test` host is not added, leaving that slug free for other apps. External development routes (for example a hostname forwarded by Cloudflare Tunnel) are additive: if no managed dev route is configured, Tako still registers the default `{app}.test` route alongside the external routes. Both `.test` and `.tako.test` DNS zones resolve simultaneously (`.tako.test` remains available as a DNS fallback; the proxy still only routes hosts that are actually registered).
  - In LAN mode, managed `.test`/`.tako.test` dev routes are additionally served via `.local` aliases (for example `app.test/api/*` also answers on `app.local/api/*`). External development routes are routable by the local proxy but are not rewritten to `.local`, advertised with mDNS, or resolved by Tako DNS.
  - On macOS, Tako configures split DNS by writing `/etc/resolver/test` and `/etc/resolver/tako.test` (one-time sudo), pointing to a local DNS listener on `127.0.0.1:53535`. If `/etc/resolver/test` already exists and was not created by Tako, Tako skips it and warns about the conflict (`.tako.test` still works).
  - On Linux, systemd-resolved routes both `~test` and `~tako.test` to the local DNS listener.
  - The dev daemon answers `A` queries for active `*.test` and `*.tako.test` hosts.
    - On macOS, it maps to a dedicated loopback address (`127.77.0.1`) used by the dev proxy.
    - On non-macOS, it maps to the dedicated loopback alias (`127.77.0.1`).
  - On macOS, `tako dev` automatically installs and repairs a launchd-managed dev proxy when missing (one-time sudo prompt):
    - Tako also installs a boot-time launchd helper that ensures the dedicated loopback alias (`127.77.0.1`) exists before the proxy is re-registered
    - launchd owns listening sockets only on `127.77.0.1`
    - `127.77.0.1:443 -> 127.0.0.1:47831`
    - `127.77.0.1:80 -> 127.0.0.1:47830` (HTTP redirect to HTTPS)
  - The dev proxy is socket-activated and may exit after a long idle window; launchd reactivates it on the next request.
  - If the dev proxy later appears inactive, `tako dev` explains that it is reloading or reinstalling the launchd helper before prompting for sudo.
  - On macOS, Tako always requires this dev proxy and always advertises `https://{app}.test/` (no explicit port).
  - After applying or repairing the dev proxy, Tako retries loopback 80/443 reachability and fails startup if those endpoints remain unreachable.
  - On macOS, Tako probes HTTPS for the app host via loopback and fails startup if that probe does not succeed.
  - If the daemon is reachable on `127.0.0.1:47831` but `https://{app}.test/` still fails, Tako reports a targeted hint that the local launchd dev proxy is not forwarding correctly.
  - `tako dev` uses routes from `[envs.development]` when configured; otherwise it defaults to `{app}.test`.
    - Dev routes may use any valid hostname. Tako only manages DNS and `.local` LAN aliases for `.test` and `.tako.test` routes.
    - Wildcard dev routes participate in proxy routing, but cannot be advertised with mDNS in LAN mode.
    - If configured dev routes contain no managed `.test`/`.tako.test` routes, Tako keeps the default `{app}.test` route and treats the configured external routes as additional host aliases.
    - Unknown managed local DNS hosts (`.test` and `.tako.test`) return a helpful 421 response that lists registered dev routes. Unknown `.local` LAN hosts and unknown external hosts return a generic `Misdirected Request` 421 response and do not enumerate registered routes.
  - The HTTPS daemon listen port for `tako dev` is fixed at `47831`.

**Local CA architecture:**

- Root CA generated once on first run; the public cert is stored at `{TAKO_HOME}/ca/ca.crt`, the private key is stored beside it as `{TAKO_HOME}/ca/ca.key` with mode `0600`, and system trust is installed once via sudo.
- The CA cert/key pair is scoped per `{TAKO_HOME}` to avoid cross-home key/cert mismatches.
- Leaf certificates generated on-the-fly for each app domain
- Public CA cert available at `{TAKO_HOME}/ca/ca.crt` (for `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`)
- On first run (or whenever not yet trusted), `tako dev` installs the root CA into the system trust store (may prompt for your password)
- Before the sudo prompt, `tako dev` explains why elevated access is needed and what will change.
- No browser security warnings once the CA is trusted

**Environment variables:**

- Loads from `[vars]` + `[vars.development]` in tako.toml; non-string TOML scalar values are stringified
- `ENV=development`
- `NODE_ENV=development`, plus runtime-specific vars (`BUN_ENV=development` for Bun)

### tako dev stop [name] [--all]

Stop a running dev app.

- Without arguments: stops the app for the selected config file (default `./tako.toml`).
- With `name`: stops the app with that name.
- `--all`: stops all registered dev apps.

### tako dev list

List all registered dev apps.

Alias: `tako dev ls`.

The list output includes the current public tunnel URL when tunnel mode is enabled for an app.

### tako doctor

Print a local diagnostic report and exit.

- Reports dev daemon listen info, macOS dev proxy status, and local DNS status.
- On macOS, includes a preflight section with clear checks for:
  - dev proxy install status
  - dev boot-helper load status
  - dedicated loopback alias status
  - launchd load status
  - TCP reachability on `{loopback-address}:443` and `{loopback-address}:80`
- If the local dev daemon is not running (missing/stale socket), doctor reports `status: not running` with a hint to start `tako dev`, and exits successfully.

### tako status

Show global deployment status from configured servers, with one compact server block per configured host:

```
Server la
  active  v0.1.0  up 3h

  Routes
    dashboard (production)  dashboard.example.com
                            *.dashboard.example.com

  Apps
    dashboard  healthy 2/2  production  abc1234  deployed Feb 8, 2026 11:48

Server nyc
  active  v0.1.0  up 2h

  Apps
    worker  healthy 1/1  production  old5678  deployed Feb 8, 2026 11:40
    worker  deploying    production  new9012
```

Shows a server summary line, then `Routes` and `Apps` sections when data is available.
Environment is inferred from the deployed app id (`app/env`); otherwise app status uses `unknown`.
App state text is color-coded (`active` and `healthy N/N` success, `idle`/`deploying`/`stopped` warning, `error`/`offline` error).
Each app row includes environment, build, and deployed timestamp when known. Timestamps are formatted in the user's current locale and local time, without timezone suffix.
`tako status` prints a single snapshot and exits.
With `--json`, status prints:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "status",
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "la",
      "host": "la.example.com",
      "port": 22,
      "description": "Primary",
      "service_status": "active",
      "server_version": "0.0.0-abc1234",
      "server_uptime": "12 days",
      "process_uptime": "3 hours",
      "routes": [{ "app": "dashboard/production", "pattern": "dashboard.example.com" }],
      "apps": [
        {
          "app_name": "dashboard",
          "env_name": "production",
          "status": {
            "service_status": "active",
            "server_version": "0.0.0-abc1234",
            "app_status": {},
            "deployed_at_unix_secs": 1770000000,
            "error": null
          }
        }
      ],
      "error": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Status flow helpers:

- `tako status` does not require `tako.toml` and can run from any directory.
- Uses global server inventory from `config.toml`.
- Queries each server through signed Tailscale HTTP remote management.
- If no servers are configured and the terminal is interactive, status offers to run the add-server wizard.
- If no deployed apps are found, status reports that explicitly.

### tako logs [--env {environment}] [--tail] [--days {N}]

View or stream logs from all servers in an environment.

- Environment defaults to `production`.
- Environment must exist in the selected config file.
- Fetches from all mapped servers in parallel.
- Includes app stdout/stderr and app-scoped Tako server diagnostics from the app log files.
  JS/TS production HTTP entrypoints route `console.*`, uncaught exceptions, and unhandled
  rejections into the same app log stream before exiting.
- Human-readable output formats log-file lines into timestamp, level, source, and message
  columns. App process sources render as `{instance}`; app-scoped server diagnostics
  render as `tako`. App stderr renders as `ERROR`; structured app JSON logs are flattened into
  the same view, with embedded newlines kept inside one log entry and indented under the
  message column. Structured `fields.error.stack` values render as indented continuation
  lines. Raw app stderr object dumps are grouped under the first stderr row when they are
  split across physical log-file lines. Interactive terminals colorize levels and scopes,
  use the app runtime color for app process sources when known, and render trailing
  metadata fields such as `instance=...` as dim italic text.
- Prefixes each line with `[server-name]` when multiple servers are present.
- Remote fetch/connect failures are reported as command failures; they are not treated as empty logs.
- Remote logs are read over signed HTTP management. History uses one bounded raw-byte fetch from
  the app's `previous.log` and `current.log`; streaming mode polls the same endpoint with byte
  offsets and starts by showing up to the last 10 current-log lines.
- With global `--json`, history mode emits a single final result object containing `ok`,
  `command`, `app`, `environment`, `days`, and `logs`. Each entry in `logs` is a structured
  log record. Structured app/worker JSON records are preserved and annotated with `source`
  and `instance_id`; `source` is the app instance id, worker name (`default` renders as
  `worker`), or `tako` for app-scoped server diagnostics. Raw app process output and
  app-scoped Tako diagnostics are wrapped into JSON records with a `level` field. When logs
  come from multiple servers, records also include `server`.

**History mode (default):**

- Shows the last `N` days of logs (default: 3).
- Applies `--days` to timestamped app log-file lines.
- Consecutive identical messages are deduplicated with a `└─ repeated N times through <timestamp>`
  marker. Same-day repeats show `HH:MM:SS`; `N` includes the first displayed row.
- All lines across servers are sorted by timestamp.
- Displays in `$PAGER` if interactive, with `less -R` as the default. Diff-only pagers such
  as `delta` fall back to `less -R`; piped output and `--json` write stdout.

**Streaming mode (`--tail`):**

- Streams logs continuously until interrupted (`Ctrl+c`).
- `--tail` conflicts with `--days`.
- With global `--json`, streaming mode emits one structured log event per stdout line rather
  than a final result object.
- Consecutive identical messages are deduplicated with a `└─ repeated N times through <timestamp>`
  marker. Same-day repeats show `HH:MM:SS`; `N` includes the first displayed row.

Logs flow helpers:

- For `production`, if no servers are configured and the terminal is interactive, logs offers to run the add-server wizard.

### tako servers add [host|admin-user@host] [--name {name}] [--description {text}] [--port {ssh-port}] [--ssh-key {path}] [--http-port {port}] [--https-port {port}] [--install] [--admin-user {user}]

Add server to global `config.toml` (`[[servers]]`).

- With `host`: adds directly from CLI args and defaults the server name to the host's first DNS label (`my-server.tailnet.ts.net` becomes `my-server`). IP addresses and hosts that do not produce a valid server name require `--name`.
- With `admin-user@host`: treats the prefix as the admin SSH user for install/repair and stores only `host`.
- Without `host` (interactive terminal): launches a guided wizard (host, SSH port, SSH key prefilled with the default `~/.ssh` key, optional SSH passphrase when the chosen key is encrypted, HTTP/HTTPS ports when installing or starting a stopped install, required server name, optional description) with a final `Looks good?` confirmation. Choosing `No` restarts the wizard. The SSH key prompt is skipped when `--ssh-key` is passed.
- If the derived server name already exists, interactive mode prompts for another name. Non-interactive mode fails and asks for `--name`.
- The add-server wizard supports `Tab` autocomplete suggestions for host/name/port from existing servers and persisted CLI history.
  - For name/port prompts, suggestions related to the selected host (and selected name for ports) are prioritized first, then global suggestions are shown.
- Successful adds record host/name/SSH-port history in `history.toml` for future autocomplete.
- `--description` stores optional human-readable metadata in `config.toml` (shown in `tako servers list`).
- `--ssh-key` stores the private key path as `key_path` in the server's `[[servers]]` entry (shown in `tako servers list`). All later SSH connections to that server use only this key. The file must exist; `tako servers add` fails otherwise.
- `--http-port` and `--https-port` set the public proxy ports used when `servers add` installs `tako-server`; omitted values default to `80` and `443`. They are distinct from `--port`, which remains the SSH port.
- Re-running with the same name/host/SSH-port/public-port tuple is idempotent (reports already configured and succeeds).

Tests SSH connection before adding. Connects as the `tako` user.

During SSH checks, `tako servers add` also detects and stores target metadata (`arch`, `libc`) and the running public proxy ports (`http_port`, `https_port`) in the matching `[[servers]]` entry in `config.toml`.

If `--no-test` is used, SSH checks and target detection are skipped; deploy later fails for that server until target metadata is captured by re-adding the server with SSH checks enabled.

If `--install` is used and `tako-server` is missing or `tako@host` is not available, `tako servers add` connects as the admin SSH user (default `root`, override with `--admin-user`) and runs the server installer over SSH in bootstrap-only mode first. Passing `admin-user@host` is shorthand for setting that admin user and enabling install/repair when needed. Interactive installs prompt for editable HTTP and HTTPS port fields prefilled with `80` and `443` unless `--http-port`/`--https-port` were passed.

Before the first service start, add-server install flows use default listener settings. Tako starts the service through the installer service-start path, rechecks `tako@host`, enrolls the same key for signed remote management, verifies signed HTTP access, and only then writes `config.toml`.

In the interactive wizard and direct host flow, if `tako-server` is missing or `tako@host` cannot be reached, Tako asks whether to install now, prompts for public HTTP/HTTPS ports, and prompts for the admin SSH user.

If `tako-server` is installed but not yet started (for example after an explicit bootstrap-only install), `tako servers add` asks whether to start it. In non-interactive install/repair mode (`--install` or `admin-user@host`), the service-start step runs automatically with default listener settings.

### tako servers remove [name]

Remove server from `config.toml` (`[[servers]]`).

When `name` is omitted in an interactive terminal, `tako` opens a server selector.
In non-interactive mode, `name` is required.

Confirms before removal. Warns that projects referencing this server will fail.

Aliases: `tako servers rm [name]`, `tako servers delete [name]`.

### tako servers list

List all configured servers from global config (`config.toml`) as a table:

- Name
- Host
- Port
- Optional description

Alias: `tako servers ls`.

If no servers are configured, `tako servers list` shows a hint to run `tako servers add`.

### tako servers reload {server-name} [--force]

Reload `tako-server` without downtime by default. `--force` performs a full service restart and may cause brief downtime for all apps.

Use default reload for normal config refresh and control-plane restarts. Use `--force` for recovery when graceful reload is not appropriate.

Service-manager reload/restart behavior:

- Default path: `systemctl reload tako-server` on systemd hosts, or `rc-service tako-server reload` on OpenRC hosts. Reload sends `SIGHUP`; the current process spawns a replacement process, the new process takes over the management socket and listener ports, then the old process drains and exits.
- `--force` path: `systemctl restart tako-server` on systemd hosts, or `rc-service tako-server restart` on OpenRC hosts.
- On systemd hosts, installer configures `KillMode=mixed` and `TimeoutStopSec=30min`, allowing the main server process to receive the first stop signal while child processes still get time to handle graceful shutdown before forced termination.
- On OpenRC hosts, installer configures `retry="TERM/1800/KILL/5"` in the init script so restart/stop waits up to 30 minutes before forced termination.

`tako-server` persists app runtime registration (app config and routes) in SQLite under the data directory and restores it on startup so app routing/config survives reloads, restarts, and crashes. Env vars are stored in `app.json` in the release directory; secrets are stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM) in the same SQLite database using a per-device key. Fresh native app and worker processes receive secrets through the fd 3 bootstrap envelope at spawn time; container instances receive the same envelope through `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`. Secret updates store the new encrypted values, then drain/restart workflow workers and roll HTTP instances so fresh processes receive the new values; secrets never touch disk as plaintext. Each deployed app also gets a persistent runtime data tree under `{data_dir}/apps/{app}/{env}/data/`:

- `app/` — app-owned data exposed to the process as `TAKO_DATA_DIR`
- `tako/` — Tako-owned per-app internal state

On root-managed production servers, release directories and `data/app/` are owned by the per-app Unix user/group and are not readable by other deployed app identities by default. `data/tako/` remains owned by `tako-server` and is not exposed to app code. Native app and worker processes keep fd 3 bootstrap, fd 4 readiness for HTTP instances, and `127.0.0.1` loopback routing, then apply a conservative umask, `NoNewPrivileges` where supported, dropped ambient capabilities where supported, and per-app resource controls. Container app instances run through Podman with only a loopback host-port publish. Linux cgroup v2 is used when available to assign native app processes to a per-app cgroup with default memory, CPU, and process-count limits; file-descriptor limits are applied per process.

Deleting an app removes the entire `{data_dir}/apps/{app}` tree after the app is drained and stopped.

During single-host upgrade orchestration, `tako-server` may enter an internal `upgrading` server mode that temporarily rejects mutating management commands (release preparation/finalization, `deploy`, `backup_now`, `restore_backup`, `scale`, `stop`, `delete`, `rollback`, `update-secrets`) until the upgrade window ends.
Upgrade mode transitions are guarded by a durable single-owner upgrade lock in SQLite so only one upgrade controller can hold the upgrade window at a time.

### tako servers upgrade [server-name]

Upgrade `tako-server` on one or all configured servers via service-manager reload. When `server-name` is omitted, all servers are upgraded.

1. CLI verifies `tako-server` is active on the host.
2. CLI installs the new server binary on the host.
   - CLI verifies the signed `tako-server-sha256s.txt` release manifest with an embedded public key, selects the expected SHA-256 for the target archive, and the remote host verifies that SHA-256 before extracting the archive into `/usr/local/bin/tako-server`. When `TAKO_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` is set for a custom release source, CLI skips signature verification for that custom manifest and still verifies the archive checksum after download.
   - before replacing the active binary, the remote host checks the extracted binary for missing runtime libraries and installs the libvips runtime only when the new binary needs it
   - custom `TAKO_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` overrides must use `https://`; non-HTTPS overrides are rejected unless `TAKO_ALLOW_INSECURE_DOWNLOAD_BASE=1` is set explicitly for local testing
   - CLI metadata downloads and remote host archive downloads use `GH_TOKEN` when set, falling back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, for GitHub-hosted release URLs only
3. CLI acquires the durable upgrade lock (`enter_upgrading`) and sets server mode to `upgrading`.
4. CLI signals the primary service with:
   - `systemctl reload tako-server` on systemd hosts, or
   - `rc-service tako-server reload` on OpenRC hosts.
     Both paths send `SIGHUP` for graceful reload, start a replacement process before the old process exits, and run with root privileges (root login or sudo-capable user).
   - Exception: when the running server does not report the current SQLite storage engine (it predates the engine change), CLI performs a full service restart instead of a reload. Overlapping the two engines on the same state databases is unsafe, so this one upgrade takes brief downtime; later upgrades reload as usual.
5. CLI waits for the primary management socket to report ready.
6. CLI releases upgrade mode (`exit_upgrading`).

`tako servers upgrade` requires a supported service manager on the host (systemd or OpenRC).

Failure behavior:

- If failure happens before the reload signal, CLI performs best-effort cleanup (exits upgrade mode).
- Upgrade keeps the previous on-disk `tako-server` binary until the replacement process reports ready. If readiness does not arrive, the previous binary is restored.
- If the reload was sent but the socket did not become ready within the timeout, CLI warns that upgrade mode may remain enabled until the primary recovers.

### tako servers uninstall [name] [-y|--yes]

Remove tako-server and all data from a remote server.

1. If `name` is omitted in an interactive terminal, prompts to select from configured servers.
2. Displays what will be removed (services, binaries, data, sockets, service files) and asks for confirmation (skipped with `-y`).
3. SSHes into the server with root/sudo privileges and:
   - Stops and disables `tako-server` and `tako-server-standby` services (systemd and OpenRC).
   - Removes systemd service files, drop-ins, and OpenRC init scripts.
   - Runs `systemctl daemon-reload` on systemd hosts.
   - Removes binaries: `/usr/local/bin/tako-server`, `tako-server-service`, `tako-server-install-refresh`.
   - Removes data directory (`/opt/tako/`) and the management socket directory (`/var/run/tako/`).
4. Removes the server from the local `config.toml` server list.

### tako credentials set [--env {environment}] [--expires-on {when}] [{name}]

Set a Tako-owned provider credential for a deployed app environment. Alias: `tako creds set ...`.

- `{name}` is a provider credential name. Credential names are lowercased before validation, so `POSTGRES_URL` is stored as `postgres_url`. Supported values: `ssl.cloudflare` and `postgres_url`. Interactive terminals can select a supported credential when `{name}` is omitted.
- `--env {environment}` selects the deployment environment. `development` is rejected because provider credentials are only used by deploy. Interactive terminals can choose an existing non-development environment when omitted; the selector offers `production` by default and does not create new environments.
- `--expires-on {when}` optionally records the date when the credential expires. Interactive runs prompt when the flag is omitted. Non-interactive runs may omit it. `YYYY-MM-DD` is stored as-is; `in N days` is normalized to the UTC date N days from now; `never`, a blank prompt, or an omitted flag stores no `expires_on` field. Timestamp values are rejected.

The command ensures the environment has an encryption key and stores the encrypted value plus optional `expires_on` metadata in `.tako/secrets.json` under that environment's `credentials` object. Provider credentials are not exposed to app code, are not included in generated secret types, and are not pushed by `tako secrets sync`. Deploy sends required provider credentials to servers only through the specific deployment binding that needs them, such as Cloudflare SSL, Let’s Encrypt DNS-01 certificate issuance, or shared runtime state storage. `postgres_url` selects shared Postgres channel/workflow storage. Deploy fails before build/deploy work starts if a required credential is missing or expired, warns if it expires within 30 days, and fails during remote prepare if the target server cannot read a Cloudflare zone needed for Let’s Encrypt DNS-01 or cannot validate a supported Cloudflare SSL token.

### tako credentials rm [--env {environment}] {name}

Remove a Tako-owned provider credential from one environment. Alias: `tako creds rm ...`.

Aliases: `tako credentials remove ...`, `tako credentials delete ...`, `tako credentials del ...`.

### tako credentials list

List supported Tako-owned provider credential names and whether each configured environment has a value set. Values are never printed. Running `tako credentials` without a subcommand shows the same overview.

Aliases: `tako credentials ls`, `tako credentials show`, `tako creds list`.

### tako uninstall [-y|--yes]

Remove the local Tako CLI and all local data.

1. Gathers removal targets:
   - **User-level:** config directory, data directory, CLI binaries (`tako`, `tako-dev-server`, `tako-dev-proxy`).
   - **System-level (requires sudo):** platform-specific services and config installed by `tako dev`:
     - macOS: dev proxy LaunchDaemons (`sh.tako.dev-proxy`, `sh.tako.dev-bootstrap`), `/Library/Application Support/Tako/`, `/etc/resolver/test`, `/etc/resolver/tako.test`, CA certificate in system keychain, loopback alias `127.77.0.1`.
     - Linux: systemd service (`tako-dev-redirect.service`), systemd-resolved drop-in (`tako-dev.conf`), CA certificate in system trust store, iptables NAT redirect rules, loopback alias `127.77.0.1`.
2. If nothing exists, reports "nothing to remove" and exits.
3. Displays what will be removed (including system items that require sudo) and asks for confirmation (skipped with `-y`).
4. Best-effort stops the dev server (unregisters all dev apps).
5. Removes system-level items via `sudo` (best-effort), then removes user-level directories and binaries.
6. Reports success or partial removal if some items could not be deleted.

### tako secrets set [--env {environment}] [--expires-on {when}] [--sync] {name}

Set/update secret for an environment.

When `--env` is omitted in an interactive terminal, Tako opens an environment wizard. The first step shows the default environments (`development`, `production`), any environments already declared in `tako.toml` or `.tako/secrets.json`, and a `New environment` option. Choosing `New environment` prompts for the environment name in the next wizard step. In non-interactive mode, `--env` is required.

After the environment is resolved, Tako prompts for the secret value with masked input in an interactive terminal. Pasted values may contain newlines; Enter submits the prompt. If an interactive value starts or ends with whitespace, Tako asks whether to trim it before storing. In non-interactive mode, Tako reads the full stdin stream and trims the final line ending. It also asks when the secret expires; pressing Enter skips expiry. `--expires-on {when}` can provide the expiry directly. `YYYY-MM-DD` is stored as-is; `in N days` is normalized to the UTC date N days from now; `never`, a blank prompt, or an omitted flag stores no `expires_on` field. Timestamp values are rejected. If the secret already exists in the selected environment during an interactive run, Tako asks for overwrite confirmation before prompting for the new value. Stores encrypted value plus optional plaintext `expires_on` metadata locally in `.tako/secrets.json`. Tako does not write `.tako/secrets.json` until the environment wizard, value prompt, and optional expiry prompt have completed.

Uses the environment's cached key from iCloud Keychain through the signed `Tako.app` CLI, or from Tako's data directory at `keys/{key_id}`. If a local key file exists and iCloud Keychain is unavailable during a read, Tako uses the local key file. If the environment has no key yet, Tako creates a random key. On macOS interactive runs, Tako offers iCloud Keychain storage, which requires the signed app bundle. If the entitlement is unavailable while saving a new key to iCloud Keychain, the command fails before writing `.tako/secrets.json`.

When `--sync` is provided, immediately syncs secrets to all servers in the target environment after the local change, triggering a rolling restart of running instances. Deploy checks app secret expiry before build/deploy work starts, fails if a selected environment secret is expired, and warns if a selected environment secret expires within 30 days.

Alias: `tako secrets add ...`.

### tako secrets rm [--env {environment}] [--sync] {name}

Remove secret from environment.

Removes from local `.tako/secrets.json`. Omitting `--env` removes the secret from all environments.

When `--sync` is provided, immediately syncs secrets to servers after the local change. If `--env` is specified, syncs to that environment; otherwise syncs to all environments.

Aliases: `tako secrets remove ...`, `tako secrets delete ...`, `tako secrets del ...`.

### tako secrets list

List all secrets with presence table across environments.

Shows which secrets exist in which environments. Warns about missing secrets. Never displays values.

Aliases: `tako secrets ls`, `tako secrets show`.

### tako secrets sync [--env {environment}]

Sync local secrets to servers.

Source of truth: local `.tako/secrets.json`.

By default, sync processes all environments declared in `tako.toml`.
When `--env` is provided, sync processes only that environment.

For each target environment, sync decrypts with the cached key from iCloud Keychain through the signed `Tako.app` CLI, or from Tako's data directory at `keys/{key_id}`. If a local key file exists and iCloud Keychain is unavailable during a read, Tako uses the local key file.

Shows a spinner with the total number of target servers while syncing, and reports the elapsed time on completion.

Sync flow helpers:

- If no servers are configured and the terminal is interactive, sync offers to run the add-server wizard.
- Environments with no mapped servers are skipped with a warning.
- If any secret in an environment fails to decrypt, that environment is not synced and is reported as an error — a partial push would replace the server's full secret set and restart the app without the failed secret.
- Sync sends `update_secrets` to `tako-server`; it does not write remote `.env` files. Secrets updates reconcile the app's workflow runtime and rolling-restart HTTP instances so fresh native processes receive the new bootstrap envelope via fd 3 and fresh container instances receive it through `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`.

### tako secrets key export [--env {environment}]

Export a self-contained key bundle to clipboard.

Reads the environment's cached key from iCloud Keychain through the signed `Tako.app` CLI, or from Tako's data directory at `keys/{key_id}`, requires macOS user authentication on macOS when reading from Keychain, and copies a single exported key string to the clipboard. If a local key file exists and iCloud Keychain is unavailable during a read, Tako uses the local key file. The string is base64url-encoded JSON containing `version`, `id`, and `key`, so it can be imported without specifying an environment.

When `--env` is omitted in an interactive terminal, Tako opens the environment wizard. In non-interactive mode, `--env` is required.

### tako secrets key import [--passphrase] [--env {environment}]

Import a self-contained exported key string.

In interactive mode, asks for the key source:

- `Exported key`: prompts for an exported key string with masked input. The payload contains the key id, so no environment is needed; `--env` can name the target environment and validates that the bundle matches it.
- `Passphrase`: prompts for an environment and passphrase. Tako derives the environment key from the passphrase and the environment key id. If the environment does not have a key id yet, Tako creates one and saves it to `.tako/secrets.json` after the passphrase flow completes. If existing secrets cannot be decrypted with the passphrase, interactive mode prompts again with `Invalid passphrase`; non-interactive mode fails without saving the key.

In non-interactive mode, `tako secrets key import --env {environment}` reads a single exported key string from stdin by default. Omitting `--env` still imports the key and matches an existing environment by key id when possible. Pass `--passphrase --env {environment}` to import a passphrase from stdin. Imported keys are stored under Tako's data directory at `keys/{id}` by default. On macOS interactive runs, Tako offers iCloud Keychain storage, which requires the signed `Tako.app` CLI. If the entitlement is unavailable while saving to iCloud Keychain, the import fails before writing a local key file or updating `.tako/secrets.json`. If the current project has an environment matching the imported `id`, reports that environment name; otherwise reports the imported id.

### tako storages add {name}

Attach an object storage binding to this app.

```bash
tako storages add uploads \
  --env production \
  --resource prod_uploads \
  --provider s3 \
  --bucket app-uploads \
  --endpoint https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com \
  --region auto \
  --public-base-url https://cdn.example.com/uploads
```

Options:

- `--env {environment}` defaults to `production`.
- `--resource {name}` sets the backing S3 resource name. It defaults to the binding name for `s3`; for `local`, omit it or set it to `local`.
- `--provider {s3|local}` defaults to `s3`.
- `--bucket {bucket}` is required for `s3`.
- `--endpoint {https-url}` is required for `s3`. R2 is configured as `provider = "s3"` with the R2 S3-compatible endpoint.
- `--region {region}` defaults to `auto`.
- `--access-key-id {value}` and `--secret-access-key {value}` are optional for `s3`; interactive runs prompt when omitted.
- `--expires-on {when}` optionally records the date when S3 credentials expire; interactive S3 runs prompt when omitted, and non-interactive S3 runs may omit it. `YYYY-MM-DD` is stored as-is; `in N days` is normalized to the UTC date N days from now; `never`, a blank prompt, or an omitted flag stores no `expires_on` field. Timestamp values are rejected.
- `--force-path-style` signs path-style object URLs instead of virtual-hosted bucket URLs for `s3`.
- `--public-base-url {https-url}` enables public object URLs for helpers that request `public: true` on `s3` bindings.

The command writes the environment binding to `tako.toml`. For `s3`, it also writes top-level resource metadata and encrypted credentials plus optional `expires_on` metadata to `.tako/secrets.json` under the selected environment's `storages` map. For `local`, it writes the binding to the built-in `local` resource and no `[storages.local]` table; local storage has no user-configured path or credentials. Deploy validates that every non-development storage binding references either a declared S3 resource or the built-in `local` resource, that S3 resources have unexpired credentials when expiry is known, warns when S3 credentials expire within 30 days, checks that credentials do not exist for unbound resources, and rejects local storage on multi-server deploy environments. There is no separate storage sync command.

### tako storages credentials {resource}

Set or rotate encrypted credentials for an existing top-level S3 storage resource without attaching it to the app runtime.

```bash
tako storages credentials r2 \
  --env production \
  --access-key-id ... \
  --secret-access-key ...
```

Options:

- `--env {environment}` defaults to `production`.
- `--access-key-id {value}` and `--secret-access-key {value}` are optional; interactive runs prompt when omitted.
- `--expires-on {when}` records optional credential expiry metadata with the same rules as `tako storages add`.

The command requires `[storages.<resource>]` to exist and to be S3-compatible. It writes only `.tako/secrets.json`; it does not add or change `[envs.<env>].storages`, so the resource is not exposed as `tako.storages.<name>` unless a separate app binding exists.

### tako backups now/list/status/download/restore

Manage app data backups for the current project.

```bash
tako backups now --env production
tako backups list --env production
tako backups status --env production
tako backups download b123 --env production --server la --output ./backup.tar.zst.enc
tako backups restore b123 --env production --server la --yes
```

- `tako backups now [--env <env>] [--server <server>]` creates a backup immediately on the selected server(s).
- `tako backups list [--env <env>] [--server <server>]` lists remote backup index entries, newest first.
- `tako backups status [--env <env>]` reports whether backups are enabled per mapped server, plus last/next backup timing and retention.
- `tako backups download <backup-id> [--env <env>] [--server <server>] [--output <path>]` downloads one encrypted backup object. If the environment maps to multiple servers, `--server` is required. The default output path is `<backup-id>.tar.zst.enc`. The output file must not already exist.
- `tako backups restore <backup-id> [--env <env>] [--server <server>] [--yes|-y]` stops the selected server's app, replaces its data tree with the archive contents, reconciles workflows, and restarts according to the app's desired instance count. If the environment maps to multiple servers, `--server` is required.

All backup commands default to `production`, require project context, and target the remote deployment id `{app}/{env}`. Backup commands use signed HTTP remote management, not SSH.

### tako deploy [--env {environment}] [--yes|-y]

Build and deploy application to environment's servers.

When `--env` is omitted, deploy targets `production`.

Deploy target environment must be declared in `tako.toml` (`[envs.<name>]`) and must define `route` or `routes`.

`development` is reserved for `tako dev` and cannot be used with `tako deploy`.

In interactive terminals, deploying to `production` requires an explicit confirmation when the environment is implicit and more than one deployable environment is declared in `tako.toml` (`development` doesn't count, since it can't be deployed). Passing `--env production`, `--yes`, or `-y` skips that confirmation because the target is explicit; so does having only one deployable environment configured, since there's no other environment the deploy could have implicitly missed.

Deploy flow helpers:

- If no servers are configured and the terminal is interactive, deploy offers to run the add-server wizard before continuing.
- For `production`, if `[envs.production].servers` is empty:
  - with one global server: deploy selects it and writes it to `[envs.production].servers` in `tako.toml`
  - with multiple global servers (interactive terminal): deploy asks you to pick one, then writes it to `[envs.production].servers`
- Interactive deploy progress:
  - after config/server/build planning is known, interactive pretty output renders tasks and sub tasks instead of a static plan box
  - waiting tasks render as muted `○`
  - deploy renders `Connecting to <server>` as a single sub task when there is one target server; with multiple target servers it renders a `Connecting` task with one sub task per server
  - if there is only one obvious build task, deploy renders it as a single `Building` sub task line
  - pending pretty task rows render with a `...` suffix
  - succeeded sub tasks hide the `✔` icon (render with a blank icon slot) only when their parent task also succeeded; when the parent failed, was cancelled, or is still running, succeeded sub tasks keep their `✔` so the completed work stays visible. Failed (`✘`), cancelled (`⊘`), skipped (`⏭`), running (spinner), and pending (`○`) sub tasks always keep their icons
  - cancelled and skipped rows render fully muted (icon, label, and detail); accent color is reserved for live or successfully completed rows
  - pending rows cancelled because another step failed omit generic cancellation detail; they remain as muted `...` rows
  - after planning completes, deploy starts the pretty `Connecting` and `Building` sections together
  - deploy does not keep startup metadata summaries inside the live tree
  - deploy renders one task per target server, with sub tasks for `Uploading`, `Preparing`, `Starting`, and `Finalizing`
  - deploy adds a blank line after each top-level pretty task section (`Connecting`, `Building`, each `Deploying to ...`)
  - sub task failures may render their related error detail on an indented line below the failed sub task
  - if a connection check or build step fails, deploy aborts the remaining incomplete pretty task-tree rows and marks them as `Aborted` instead of leaving them pending
  - verbose and CI deploy output stay transcript-style and only print work as it is happening
  - When `release` is configured for the resolved env, deploy adds a
    release sub-step under each server's `Preparing` task. The leader's
    row reads `Running release command`; followers' rows read
    `Waiting for release command` and resolve once the leader finishes.
    On leader failure, followers' rows are marked `Cancelled` with a
    `leader failed` detail.

**Steps:**

1. Pre-deployment validation (secrets present and unexpired, S3 credentials present and unexpired for selected storage bindings and configured backup storage, provider credentials present and unexpired when Cloudflare SSL is selected, Let’s Encrypt routes include wildcards, or shared channel/workflow storage is required, multi-server channel deploys require `postgres_url`, multi-server JS workflow deploys require `postgres_url` unless every workflow definition sets `local: true`, multi-server Go workflow deploys require `postgres_url`, warnings for app/S3/provider credentials expiring within 30 days, server target metadata present/valid for all selected servers)
2. Resolve source bundle root (git root when available; otherwise app directory)
3. Resolve app subdirectory from the selected config file's parent directory relative to source bundle root
4. Resolve deploy runtime `main` (`main` from `tako.toml`; otherwise manifest main such as `package.json` `main`; otherwise preset `main`, with JS index fallback order: `index.<ext>` then `src/index.<ext>` for `ts`/`tsx`/`js`/`jsx` when applicable)
5. Resolve app preset (top-level `preset` in `tako.toml`), fetching unpinned official aliases from `master`
6. Prepare build dir: copy project from source root into `.tako/build` (respecting `.gitignore`), symlink `node_modules/` directories from original tree, and preserve other symlinks as symlinks
7. Run build commands in build dir:
   - Resolve stage list by precedence: `[[build_stages]]` → `[build]` (single-stage form) → runtime default stage → no-op
   - Run resolved stages in declaration order (`install` then `run` per stage)
   - Merge configured assets into app `public/`
   - Verify resolved runtime `main` exists in the built app directory
   - Save resolved runtime version into `app.json` (`runtime_version` field) for server-side version pinning
8. Archive build dir (excluding `node_modules/`) as deploy artifact
   - Source and build archives preserve symlinks as links instead of following them; directory symlinks are not expanded into the artifact
   - Version format: clean git tree => `{commit}`; dirty git tree => `{commit}_{source_hash8}`; no git commit => `nogit_{source_hash8}`
   - Best-effort local artifact cache prune runs before builds (retention: 90 target artifacts; orphan target metadata is removed)
   - Package filtered artifact tarball using include/exclude rules and store in local cache
9. On all servers in parallel: upload artifact, extract, and prepare runtime
   - Require `tako-server` to be pre-installed and running on each server
   - Ask the server for a release upload plan over signed HTTP. If the release is not already present, upload the target-specific artifact to `POST /release-artifact`; the server verifies the declared size and SHA-256 digest, extracts the artifact into the release directory, and links release logs to the app's shared log directory.
   - Query server for the app's current secrets hash; if it matches the local secrets hash, skip sending secrets (server keeps existing). If hashes differ (or app is new), include decrypted secrets in the deploy command.
   - Include the decrypted SSL binding in the deploy command. If the binding has a Cloudflare token, `tako-server` stores it encrypted for certificate operations for that deployed app. Otherwise, the server clears stored SSL credentials for that app.
   - Include the decrypted backup binding and backup keys when `[envs.<env>].backup` is configured. If backup is omitted, `tako-server` clears any previous backup config for that deployed app.
   - `tako-server` acquires a per-app deploy lock in memory, reads non-secret runtime/app config from release `app.json`, creates per-app runtime data directories, and either runs the native runtime plugin's production install command or builds the container image
   - If another deploy for the same app environment is already running on that server, the deploy command fails immediately with a retry message
10. Run release command on the leader server (when configured):
    - If `release` is configured for the resolved env, the leader server
      runs `sh -c "<command>"` once inside the new release directory.
      Followers' `Preparing` task blocks until the leader publishes its
      result.
    - On success, all servers proceed into rolling update (existing
      behavior).
    - On failure (non-zero exit, timeout, or signal), deploy aborts on
      every server. The existing partial-release cleanup removes the new
      release directory on each server. The `current` symlink is not
      updated; old instances keep serving.
11. Rolling update and finalize on all servers:
    - `tako-server` performs first start or rolling update. During rolling update, replacement instances stay out of public request routing until every new batch remains healthy through the rollout stability window. If any new batch becomes unhealthy during that window, the server kills the new instances, restores the previous release metadata, keeps old instances serving, and returns a rollback error to the CLI.
    - Update `current` symlink and clean up old releases (>30 days or over 50 total releases)
    - If backups are enabled, create a post-deploy app data backup on each finalized server

**Version naming:**

- Clean git tree: `{commit_hash}` (e.g., `abc1234`)
- Dirty working tree: `{commit_hash}_{content_hash}` (first 8 chars each)
- No git commit/repo: `nogit_{content_hash}` (first 8 chars)

**Source deploy contract:**

- Deploy archive source is the app's source bundle root (git root when available; otherwise selected-config parent directory).
- Deploy target app path is the selected config file's parent directory relative to the source bundle root.
- Build uses a build dir: copies project from source root into `.tako/build` (respecting `.gitignore`), symlinks `node_modules/` from the original tree (build tools read but don't modify), runs build commands in the build dir, then archives the result excluding `node_modules/`. Source and build archives preserve symlinks as symlinks; directory symlinks are not followed, and source hashes track symlink targets for cache invalidation.
- These paths are always force-excluded from the deploy archive: `.git/`, `.tako/`, `.env*`, `node_modules/`. Additional exclusions come from `[build].exclude` and `.gitignore`.
- Servers receive prebuilt native artifacts or source-backed container artifacts and do not run native app build stages during deploy. After extracting a native artifact, `tako-server` runs the runtime plugin's production install command (e.g. `bun install --production`) before starting instances unless the manifest has an explicit `start` command. After extracting a container artifact, `tako-server` builds the configured container image with Podman. Production install runs with the release env plus minimal process env (`PATH`, `HOME` when available); it does not inherit arbitrary `tako-server` service environment variables. When `tako-server` is root, each deployed app id (`{app}/{env}`) gets a deterministic Unix user and primary group (`tako-<hash>`). Native production install, release commands, HTTP instances, and workflow workers for that app run as that per-app user, with the shared `tako-app` group retained only as a supplementary group for access to Tako's internal socket. If the per-app identity or shared group cannot be resolved or created, root `tako-server` fails closed instead of running app code as root.
- Build logic runs in the build dir against the resolved stage list (precedence: `[[build_stages]]` → `[build]` → runtime default). Each stage runs `install` then `run` in declaration order.
- Deploy uses the version pin from `runtime = "<id>@<version>"` when set. Otherwise it resolves runtime version by running `<tool> --version` directly, falling back to `latest`. Explicit `start` releases without a runtime skip runtime version probing.
- Artifact include precedence: in simple build mode, `build.include` -> `**/*`. In multi-stage mode, `**/*` is used (stages control output via `exclude` patterns only).
- Asset roots are preset `assets` plus top-level `assets` (deduplicated), merged into app `public/` after build with ordered overwrite.
- Target artifacts are cached locally by deterministic key and reused across deploys when build inputs are unchanged.
- Cached artifacts are validated by checksum/size before reuse; invalid cache entries are rebuilt automatically.
- Deploy artifacts include the canonical `app.json` used by `tako-server` at runtime.
- Release `app.json` contains resolved runtime metadata (`runtime`, `main`, `package_manager`), non-secret env vars, JS `app_root`, environment idle timeout, and optional release metadata (`commit_message`, `git_dirty`) used by `tako releases list`.
- Deploy does not write a release `.env` file; non-secret env vars live in release `app.json`, and secrets are stored encrypted in SQLite on the server. Native spawns receive runtime vars (`TAKO_BUILD`, `TAKO_DATA_DIR`, and `TAKO_APP_ROOT` for JS apps) when spawning HTTP instances and workflow workers. Container HTTP and workflow spawns receive `TAKO_BUILD`, app vars, `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`, `HOST=0.0.0.0`, and `PORT=3000` in v0; workflow containers also receive a mounted internal socket.
- Deploy queries each server's secrets hash before sending the deploy command. If the hash matches the local secrets, secrets are omitted from the payload and the server keeps its existing secrets. This avoids unnecessary secret transmission and ensures new servers or servers with stale secrets are automatically provisioned.
- Deploy sends backup storage only through the backup binding. It is stored encrypted server-side and is never included in the fd 3 app bootstrap envelope unless it is also listed under `[envs.<env>].storages`.
- Deploy requires valid `arch` and `libc` metadata in each selected `[[servers]]` entry.
- Deploy does not probe server targets during deploy; missing/invalid target metadata fails deploy early with guidance to remove/re-add affected servers.
- Deploy pre-validation still fails when target environment is missing secret keys used by other environments.
- Deploy pre-validation warns (but does not fail) when target environment has extra secret keys not present in other secret environments.

**Deploy lock (server-side):**

- `tako-server` serializes deploys per deployed app id (`{name}/{env}`) using an in-memory lock
- A second deploy command for the same app environment on the same server fails immediately with `Deploy already in progress for app '{app}'. Please wait and try again.`
- No `.deploy_lock` directory is written to disk
- Restarting `tako-server` clears the lock; the interrupted deploy fails and can be retried without manual lock cleanup
- The same per-app deploy lock guards the release command; a concurrent
  deploy attempt for the same app sees the existing
  "Deploy already in progress" error.

**Rolling update (per server):**

1. Start new instance
2. Wait for health check pass (30s timeout)
3. Keep replacement instances out of public request routing until every new batch stays healthy for the rollout stability window (8s by default)
4. Add the stable replacement set to request routing, then gracefully stop old instances (drain connections, 30s timeout)
5. Repeat until all instances replaced
6. Update `current` symlink to the new release directory
7. Clean up releases older than 30 days or over 50 total releases

Rolling update target counts use the app's current desired instance count stored on that server (not old+new combined counts).
During rollout validation, the server may temporarily run both the old instance set and the new replacement set.
When the stored desired instance count is `0`, rolling deploy still starts one warm instance for the new build so traffic is immediately served after deploy.

**On failure:** Automatic rollback - kill new instances, keep old ones running, restore the previous release metadata, and return a rollback error to CLI.

**App start command (current):**

- Release `app.json` is required for app startup.
- tako-server derives the start command from the runtime plugin, resolving the SDK entrypoint from the app dir or parent dirs:
  - `bun`: `bun run <resolved-entrypoint> <app.json.main>`
  - `node`: `node --experimental-strip-types <resolved-entrypoint> <app.json.main>`
  - `go`: `<app.json.main>` (compiled binary runs directly — no runtime binary or SDK entrypoint wrapper needed)
  - if the entrypoint is missing, warm-instance startup fails with an explicit error
- Unknown runtime values in `app.json` are rejected with an explicit unsupported-runtime error.

**Partial failure:** If some servers fail while others succeed, deployment continues. Failures are reported at the end.

**Disk space preflight:** Before uploading artifacts, `tako deploy` asks each target server to check free space under its configured data directory.

- Required free space is based on archive size plus unpack headroom.
- If free space is insufficient, deploy fails early with required vs available sizes.

**Failed deploy cleanup:** If a deploy fails after creating a new release directory, `tako deploy` automatically removes that newly-created partial release directory before returning an error.

**Deployment target:**

- If `[envs.<env>].servers` exists in `tako.toml` → deploy to those servers
- If deploying to `production` with no `[envs.production].servers` mapping:
  - exactly one server in `config.toml` `[[servers]]` → use it and persist it into `[envs.production].servers`
  - multiple servers in `config.toml` `[[servers]]` (interactive terminal) → prompt to select one and persist it into `[envs.production].servers`
- If no servers exist in `config.toml` `[[servers]]` → fail with hint to run `tako servers add <host>`
- Otherwise, require explicit `[envs.<env>].servers` mapping in tako.toml

### tako releases list [--env {environment}]

List release/build history for the current app across mapped environment servers.

- Environment defaults to `production`.
- Environment must exist in `tako.toml` (`[envs.<name>]`).
- Server targeting follows `[envs.<name>].servers` for the selected environment.
- Output is release-centric and sorted newest-first:
  - line 1: release/build id + deployed timestamp
    - when deployed within 24 hours, append a muted relative hint in braces (for example `{3h ago}`)
  - line 2: commit message + cleanliness marker (`[clean]`, `[dirty]`, or `[unknown]`)
- `[current]` marks the release currently pointed to by server `current` symlink.
- Commit metadata (`commit_message`, `git_dirty`) comes from release `app.json` when available; older releases may show `[unknown]` or `(no commit message)`.

### tako releases rollback {release-id} [--env {environment}] [--yes|-y]

Roll back the current app/environment to a previously deployed release/build id.

- Environment defaults to `production`.
- In interactive terminals, rollback to `production` requires explicit confirmation unless `--yes` (or `-y`) is provided.
- Rollback is executed per mapped server in parallel.
- tako-server performs rollback by reusing current app routes/env/secrets/scaling config and switching runtime path/version to the target release, then running the standard rolling-update flow.
- Partial failures are reported per server; successful servers remain rolled back.

### tako scale {instances} [--env {environment}] [--server {server}] [--app {app}]

Change the desired instance count for a deployed app.

- `instances` is the desired instance count per targeted server.
- In project context, Tako resolves the app name from the selected config file (or selected-config parent directory fallback when top-level `name` is unset).
- In project context, app-scoped server commands target the remote deployment identity `{app}/{env}`.
- Outside project context, `--app` is required. Use `--app <app> --env <env>` or pass the full deployment id as `--app <app>/<env>`.
- When `--server` is omitted, `--env` is required and Tako scales every server listed in `[envs.<env>].servers`.
- When `--server` is provided, Tako scales only that server.
- In project context, `tako scale --server <server>` defaults to `production`.
- When both `--env` and `--server` are provided, the server must belong to that environment.
- Scale uses persisted runtime app state on the server, so the desired instance count survives deploys, rollbacks, and server restarts.
- Scale fails if the requested count is above the app's effective server maximum.
- Scaling to `0` drains and stops excess instances after in-flight requests finish (or drain timeout).

### tako delete [--env {environment}] [--server {server}] [--yes|-y]

Delete a deployed app from one specific environment/server deployment target.

Target selection behavior:

- `tako delete` removes exactly one deployment target, not every server in an environment.
- In an interactive terminal, when Tako needs more information it first loads deployment state with a `Getting deployment information` spinner.
- In project context (selected config file present), Tako resolves the app name from the selected config:
  - with neither `--env` nor `--server`, Tako prompts with deployed targets like `production from hkg`
  - with `--env` only, Tako prompts for a matching server
  - with `--server` only, Tako prompts for a matching environment
  - with both `--env` and `--server`, Tako skips discovery and goes straight to confirmation
- Outside project context, Tako discovers deployed targets across configured servers and includes app selection when needed because there is no local app context.
- In non-interactive mode, `--yes`, `--env`, and `--server` are all required. Outside project context, those flags must still identify a single deployed target; otherwise the command fails with guidance to rerun interactively from the app directory or with `-c`.

Validation:

- In project mode, `--env` must be declared in the selected config file (`[envs.<name>]`).
- `--server` must name a configured server from `config.toml` `[[servers]]`.
- `development` is reserved for `tako dev` and cannot be used with `tako delete`.

Delete confirmation:

- Interactive terminals require explicit confirmation unless `--yes` (or `-y`) is provided.
- The confirmation prompt always names the app, environment, and server being removed.
- Non-interactive terminals require `--yes`.

**Steps:**

1. Discover deployed app ids from configured servers over signed HTTP remote management.
2. Send `delete` over signed HTTP to the selected `tako-server` for the remote deployment id `{app-name}/{env-name}`.
3. `tako-server` drains and stops the app, removes runtime state, and removes `{data_dir}/apps/{app-name}/{env-name}` from disk.

- Interactive single-target deletes show a spinner while the selected server is being cleaned up.
- Delete is idempotent for absent app state (safe to re-run for cleanup).

Aliases: `tako rm`, `tako remove`, `tako undeploy`, `tako destroy`.

## Routing and Multi-App Support

### Route Configuration

Apps specify routes at environment level (not per-server). Routes support:

- Exact hostname: `api.example.com`
- Wildcard subdomain: `*.api.example.com`
- Hostname + path: `api.example.com/api/*`
- Wildcard + path: `*.example.com/admin/*`

**Validation rules:**

- Routes must include hostname (path-only routes such as `"/api/*"` are invalid)
- Exact path routes normalize trailing slash (`example.com/api` and `example.com/api/` are equivalent)
- Each `[envs.{env}]` can have either `route` or `routes`, not both
- `[envs.{env}]` accepts environment behavior keys (`route`/`routes`, `servers`, `storages`, `backup`, `source_ip`, `ssl`, `idle_timeout`, and `release`); env vars belong in `[vars]` / `[vars.{env}]`
- Each non-development environment must define `route` or `routes`
- Empty route lists are invalid for non-development environments
- Development routes may use any valid hostname. Tako manages DNS and `.local` LAN aliases only for `.test` and `.tako.test` routes; external dev routes must be pointed at the dev proxy by the user.

### Multi-App Scenarios

**Apps with routes:**

- Each app specifies its routes
- Requests matched to most specific route (exact > wildcard, longer path > shorter)
- For static asset requests (paths with a file extension), `tako-server` serves files directly from the deployed app `public/` directory when present. Static responses carry an `ETag`, and requests whose `If-None-Match` matches return `304 Not Modified` without a body.
- For path-prefixed routes (for example `example.com/app/*`), static asset lookup also tries the prefix-stripped path (for example `/app/assets/main.js` -> `/assets/main.js`) so public assets work on subpaths.
- Conflict detection during deploy prevents overlapping routes
- Requests without a matching route return `404`

**Wildcard subdomains:**

- `*.example.com` routes to app, app handles tenant logic based on subdomain

### Routing Logic (tako-server)

1. Parse incoming request (Host header, path)
2. Match against deployed apps' routes
3. Select most specific match
4. Route to app's round-robin load balancer
5. Return 404 if no match

## Tako Server

### Installation

Users run a server setup script (or equivalent manual steps) to:

1. Create dedicated OS users/groups: `tako` for SSH access and running `tako-server`, plus the shared `tako-app` group used by app and worker processes to reach the internal socket
2. Install `tako-server` to `/usr/local/bin/tako-server`
3. Install and enable a host service definition for `tako-server`:
   - systemd unit on systemd hosts
   - OpenRC init script on OpenRC hosts
4. Create and permissions required directories:
   - Data dir: `/opt/tako`
   - Socket dir: `/var/run/tako`
5. Prepare only installer-managed ownership:
   - The installer sets ownership/mode on the data root, socket root, and files it writes directly.
   - The installer does not recursively change ownership under deployed app releases; deploy-time release creation owns those trees.

Recommended: run the hosted installer script on the server (as root):

```bash
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://tako.sh/install-server.sh)"
```

Custom public proxy ports can be supplied as installer args:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tako.sh/install-server.sh | sudo sh -s -- --http-port 8080 --https-port 8443
```

Installer SSH key behavior:

- If `TAKO_SSH_PUBKEY` is set, installer uses it and skips prompting.
- If unset and a terminal is available, installer prompts for a public key to authorize for user `tako` (including `sudo sh -c "$(curl ...)"` and common piped installs such as `curl ... | sudo sh`) and re-prompts on invalid input until a valid SSH public key line is provided.
- If terminal key input cannot be read, installer attempts to reuse the first valid key from the invoking `SUDO_USER` `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; if unavailable, installer continues without key setup and prints a warning with a `TAKO_SSH_PUBKEY` rerun hint.
- If unset and no terminal is available, installer attempts the same invoking-user key fallback before warning and continuing without key setup.
- CLI SSH connections require host key verification against `~/.ssh/known_hosts` (or configured SSH keys directory); unknown/changed host keys are rejected.
- Installer detects host target (`arch` + `libc`) and downloads matching artifact name `tako-server-linux-{arch}-{libc}` (supported: `x86_64`/`aarch64` with `glibc`/`musl`).
- Installer ensures `nc` (netcat) is available so CLI management commands can talk to `/var/run/tako/tako.sock`.
- Installer installs the host libvips runtime used by the built-in image optimizer before starting `tako-server`.
- Installer ensures basic networking tools are available for server operation.
- Installer creates the `tako` OS user and the shared `tako-app` group. `tako-server` runs as `tako`; root-managed app and worker processes run as per-app Unix users created from the deployed app id and keep `tako-app` only as a supplementary group. If a root `tako-server` cannot resolve or create the per-app identity or shared group, it refuses to run production install, release commands, HTTP instances, or workflow workers as root.
- Installer prepares the `/opt/tako` and `/var/run/tako` roots without recursively traversing existing app releases.
- Installer installs restricted maintenance helpers and scoped sudoers policy so the `tako` SSH user can perform non-interactive server upgrade/reload operations.
- When the installer installs or accepts `TAKO_SSH_PUBKEY`, it also enrolls that public key for signed remote management in `/opt/tako/management-authorized-keys`.
- Installer supports systemd and OpenRC hosts.
- Installer defaults to service-start mode (`TAKO_RESTART_SERVICE=1`): it installs/refreshes the binary, users, directories, helpers, sudoers policy, and service definition, then enables and starts or reloads `tako-server`.
- Bootstrap-only mode (`TAKO_RESTART_SERVICE=0`) installs or refreshes files without enabling, starting, or reloading `tako-server`. `tako servers add --install` and `admin-user@host` add/repair flows run bootstrap-only mode first, then run service-start mode to start the service with default listener settings.
- Installer writes `tako-server --http-port {port} --https-port {port}` into the host service definition. Service-start mode prompts for `HTTP port [80]:` and `HTTPS port [443]:` when a terminal is available; bootstrap-only mode never prompts for ports and uses existing service ports or `80`/`443` unless `--http-port`/`--https-port` or `TAKO_HTTP_PORT`/`TAKO_HTTPS_PORT` are provided. Reinstalls use the existing service ports as prompt defaults when present.
- If service public ports change, installer performs a full service restart so the service manager command line takes effect. Otherwise, active services use the normal zero-downtime reload path.
- For normal service installs, installer configures remote management on the server's Tailscale IP. It detects that address with `tailscale ip -4` or uses `TAKO_MANAGEMENT_HOST` when set. If no Tailscale IP is available, install fails with: `Remote management requires Tailscale so Tako can keep server control traffic private by default.`
- Installer configures service capability support for privileged binds, app-user switching, and stopping app processes after switching users:
  - systemd: `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE CAP_SETUID CAP_SETGID CAP_KILL`, `CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE CAP_SETUID CAP_SETGID CAP_KILL`
  - non-systemd/OpenRC hosts: installer applies `setcap cap_net_bind_service,cap_setuid,cap_setgid,cap_kill=+ep /usr/local/bin/tako-server`; install fails if the capability cannot be granted
- Installer configures a high file-descriptor limit for the `tako-server` service so the proxy and spawned app processes can handle high connection counts without inheriting a low default shell limit.
- Installer configures graceful stop semantics:
  - systemd: `KillMode=mixed`, `TimeoutStopSec=30min`
  - OpenRC: `retry="TERM/1800/KILL/5"`
- Installer verifies `tako-server` is active after service start; if startup fails, installer exits non-zero and prints available service diagnostics.

- `scripts/install-tako.sh` (source for `/install.sh`)

**Runtime binary download engine:**

- `tako-server` downloads runtime binaries directly from upstream releases using download specs in runtime plugins (no external version manager dependency).
- Supports zip and tar.gz archive formats with SHA-256 checksum verification.
- Downloaded binaries are cached at `{data_dir}/runtimes/{tool}/{version}/`.
- GitHub-backed runtime version checks and runtime downloads use `GH_TOKEN` when set, falling back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- Supports musl detection for Alpine and other musl-based systems.
- If the runtime plugin has no download spec, the binary must be available on PATH.

**Default behavior (no custom installer ports needed):**

- HTTP: port 80
- HTTPS: port 443
- Remote management HTTP: port 9844, bound only to a private Tailscale address by normal server installs
- Data: `/opt/tako`
- Socket: `/var/run/tako/tako.sock`
- SSL: Let’s Encrypt ACME by default; Cloudflare Origin CA per deployed app when selected
- Renewal check interval: Every 12 hours (renews certificates 30 days before expiry)
- HTTP requests redirect to HTTPS (`307`, non-cacheable) by default.
- Exception: `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` stays on HTTP.
- When HTTPS uses a non-default public port, deploy summaries include that port in printed route URLs and HTTP redirects target the configured HTTPS port.
- Forwarded HTTPS metadata (`X-Forwarded-Proto` and `Forwarded: proto=https`) is honored only from loopback peers, Cloudflare peers, or peers listed in server `trusted_proxy.trusted_cidrs`. Direct clients cannot bypass HTTPS redirects by spoofing those headers.
- For trusted forwarded peers, requests for private/local hostnames (`localhost`, `*.localhost`, single-label hosts, and reserved suffixes like `*.local`) are treated as already HTTPS when proxy proto metadata is missing, so local dev proxy setups do not enter redirect loops.
- Proxied upstream responses are not stored in a shared edge cache by default. Static assets and image optimization have separate cache behavior.
- Deployed proxied app responses are compressed at the browser-facing proxy layer when the client advertises Brotli or gzip and the upstream response is safe to transform. Brotli is preferred over gzip when negotiation quality is tied; zstd is not advertised by default.
- Compression applies to successful text, JSON, JavaScript, CSS, XML, WASM, and SVG responses with a known `Content-Length` of at least 1024 bytes. Tako removes the original `Content-Length`, `ETag`, and `Content-MD5`, sets `Content-Encoding`, and ensures `Vary: Accept-Encoding` is present for responses whose body can vary by client encoding support.
- Compression skips HEAD requests, upgrades/WebSockets, SSE, unknown-length or streaming responses, already encoded responses, `Cache-Control: no-transform`, small responses, and unsupported binary content such as common image, video, audio, archive, and font payloads. Skipped eligible responses still get `Vary: Accept-Encoding` when another client encoding would change the emitted body.
- Local development proxy traffic stays uncompressed by Tako so debugging response bodies remains straightforward.
- Each proxied or Tako-handled app request gets a request ID. `tako-server` reuses a safe incoming `X-Request-ID` when present, otherwise generates one, forwards it to app upstreams, and includes it in app-scoped proxy diagnostics visible through `tako logs`.
- App-scoped proxy diagnostics include request ID, host, method, path, matched route, app id, instance id when selected, status, HTTPS state, handler path (`proxy`, `static`, `image`, `channel`, `redirect`, or `acme`), handler/cache result, total latency, route lookup time, cold-start wait time when a scale-to-zero request wakes an app, upstream response-header latency when proxied, and response compression fields for algorithm, skip reason, whether `Vary` was required, and uncompressed/compressed byte counts when available.
- Per-IP rate limiting: maximum 2048 concurrent active requests per client IP by default; excess requests receive `429`. `TAKO_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_IP` can override the server process default for controlled benchmarks or deliberately tuned deployments.
- Maximum HTTP request body size: 128 MiB; larger requests receive `413`.
- Maximum channel WebSocket frame payload size: 128 MiB; larger frames are rejected and the socket closes.
- Production browser-facing `tako-server` 5xx responses use generic reason-phrase bodies such as `Internal Server Error`, `Bad Gateway`, `Service Unavailable`, or `Gateway Timeout`; detailed app-scoped startup, proxy, channel storage, and static file diagnostics are recorded in the app log stream instead of returned in response bodies.
- After a request matches an app route, `/_tako/*` is reserved for Tako-owned public endpoints. `/_tako/channels/<name>` serves durable channels, `/_tako/image` serves public optimized images, and `/_tako/storages/<binding>/<key>` serves signed local storage GET/PUT requests. Other request paths are served as static assets when a matching file exists in `public/`, then proxied to the app.

**Public image optimization:**

- JavaScript code can call `imageUrl(source, opts?)` from `tako.sh` to build a public optimizer URL. It is synchronous and does not sign. Omitted options use `width: 1200`, default quality `75`, and negotiated output from `[images].formats`.
- The helper returns a canonical query URL: `/_tako/image?src=<source>&w=<width>[&q=<quality>][&f=<format>]`. It emits `q` only when the requested quality differs from `75`.
- JavaScript code can call `imageSrcSet(source, opts)` from `tako.sh` to build responsive public image sources for plain `<img>` usage. It returns `{ src, srcSet, sizes }`, uses `imageUrl` for each candidate, and supports `layout = "constrained" | "full-width" | "fixed"` plus optional explicit `widths` and `sizes`. `constrained` derives `sizes = "(min-width: <width>px) <width>px, 100vw"`, `full-width` derives `sizes = "100vw"`, and `fixed` derives `sizes = "<width>px"`. Generated widths must be allowed public optimizer widths.
- Public optimizer requests fail closed. `src` and `w` are required; `q` and `f` are optional; duplicate or unknown query params are rejected. Width must be in `[images].sizes`, quality must be in `[images].qualities`, and format must be in `[images].formats`. When `f` is omitted, Tako chooses the first configured format supported by the request `Accept` header, falling back to the first configured format. The defaults are sizes `[320, 640, 960, 1200, 1920]`, qualities `[75]`, and formats `["webp"]`.
- Local sources are path-only URLs such as `/assets/hero.jpg`. Local paths are allowed by default with `local_patterns = ["/**"]`; setting `[images].local_patterns` replaces that default. In deploys, local paths resolve from the app's deployed `public/` directory first, then from the matched app backend; in dev, local paths are fetched from the active app backend.
- Remote sources must be `http` or `https` URLs and must match `[images].remote_patterns`. Remote patterns are glob-like URL strings, not regular expressions. If the pattern omits a protocol, Tako allows both `http` and `https`. Remote URLs reject unsupported schemes, userinfo, fragments, recursive image optimizer URLs, private/local hosts and IPs, private/local DNS results, and redirects.
- Public image responses use `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`. Responses whose output format is negotiated from `Accept` also use `Vary: Accept`, and image response ETags are derived from the emitted bytes and content type. This browser/CDN response cache policy is separate from Tako's origin source and transform caches.
- In deploys, `tako-server` validates the request before using origin caches. Source bytes are kept in a short-lived in-memory cache scoped by app, release root, and source identity, so one page requesting the same source with multiple transform parameters reuses the source load. The source cache is bounded to 10 seconds, 64 MiB, and 256 entries, and concurrent loads for the same source key are deduplicated in process.
- Successful transformed variants are cached on local disk under the system temp directory, such as `/tmp/tako-image-cache`. Transform cache keys include the app name, release root, source bytes, and transform options, so changed source files and different app releases produce new variants. The transform cache is best-effort, local to each server, and pruned after writes by age and size: entries older than 30 days are removed, then the oldest remaining files are removed until the cache is within its filesystem-based cap. The cap is 5% of the filesystem containing the cache directory, clamped between 1 GiB and 4 GiB; if filesystem size cannot be read, the cap falls back to 2 GiB. Concurrent cache misses for the same transform key are deduplicated in process so only one worker computes that variant while the other requests wait for the result.
- In deploys, `tako-server` runs libvips resize and encode work through a managed internal pool of isolated child worker processes. The pool is shared by apps on the same server, keeps workers warm for recent transform traffic, and scales idle workers back to zero. Workers run with conservative concurrency and reduced OS priority where supported so image transforms do not take the main proxy and app process budget by default. Cache hits and duplicate in-flight misses do not enter the worker queue. New cache misses wait for an available worker slot until the bounded queue is full; once full, new transform attempts fail with `503 Service Unavailable`. The worker execution timeout starts only after the transform begins. If an image worker crashes or times out, the server process stays up and the transform failure fallback rules apply. Transform fallbacks emit app-scoped warnings that are visible through `tako logs`.
- The optimizer uses libvips for resize and encode work. It enforces source byte and decoded image limits, preserves aspect ratio, does not upscale, and strips source metadata from transformed output. EXIF orientation is applied to the pixels before output is encoded, but EXIF, XMP, ICC profiles, comments, and other source metadata are not retained. Public requests downscale to at most `width`. Current transforms accept JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, and AVIF sources by file signature, not `Content-Type` alone. Animated GIF and WebP sources preserve animation for width-only resizes, `contain` resizes, center-cover crops, and smart-cover crops when emitted as WebP. AVIF output is available for still transforms; animated sources that request AVIF fall back to WebP because the current libvips HEIF save path supports multipage AVIF output, not browser-timed AVIF animation. The optimizer emits WebP by default; AVIF is available when requested and allowed by `[images].formats`.
- If a verified source is loaded successfully but resize/encode work fails, `tako-server` serves the original source bytes when the source response has an `image/*` content type. Fallback responses use `Cache-Control: private, no-store` so a transient transform failure cannot be stored as the long-lived public optimized variant. Source validation, source-size, decoded-size, and worker queue saturation failures do not fall back.
- Failed image optimizer responses use non-shared error caching (`Cache-Control: private, no-store`).

**Object storage runtime bindings:**

- Storage bindings are configured with `tako storages add` or `[envs.<env>].storages` in `tako.toml` and delivered to JavaScript apps on `tako.storages.<name>`. `tako generate` augments the `TakoStorages` interface from `tako.toml`; development names are preferred when present, otherwise generation uses the union of all environments.
- `await tako.storages.uploads.createDownloadUrl(key, options?)` creates a private signed `GET` URL. For `s3`, it uses SigV4. For `local`, it returns a signed app-local `/_tako/storages/uploads/<key>` URL served from the app data directory. `expiresInSeconds` defaults to `3600` and is capped at `604800`. Download options may set S3 response content type/disposition overrides. Passing `public: true` returns `public_base_url + key` when an `s3` binding has a `public_base_url`.
- `await tako.storages.uploads.createUploadUrl(key, options?)` creates a private signed `PUT` URL. For `s3`, `contentType` signs the `content-type` header, so upload clients must send the same header. For `local`, the SDK returns the same app-local object route and signs the `PUT` method into the token.
- `await tako.storages.uploads.createImageUrl(key, imageOptions?)` returns a private signed object URL when no image transform options are supplied. With `{ public: true }` and an `s3` storage `public_base_url`, it returns the public optimizer URL for that object. Private storage image transforms are a separate feature; for now transform options without public storage access fail with guidance to use `createDownloadUrl`.
- `await tako.storages.uploads.createImageSrcSet(key, imageSrcSetOptions)` returns public responsive image sources for a storage object when called with `{ public: true }` and the binding has `public_base_url`. Private storage image srcsets are a separate feature; for now they fail with guidance to use `createDownloadUrl`.
- Object keys must be non-empty relative keys and cannot start with `/`. S3-compatible endpoints must use HTTPS. R2 is configured as `provider = "s3"` with the R2 endpoint and usually `region = "auto"`.

**`/opt/tako/config.json`** — server-level configuration:

```json
{
  "server_name": "prod",
  "trusted_proxy": {
    "proxy_protocol": false,
    "trusted_cidrs": ["127.0.0.1/32"],
    "client_ip_headers": ["x-forwarded-for", "forwarded"]
  }
}
```

- `server_name` — identity label for Prometheus metrics (defaults to hostname if absent).
- `trusted_proxy` remains an advanced server-level escape hatch for PROXY protocol deployments and non-loopback trusted front proxies. It is not configured by the CLI. App/environment-level source-IP behavior is selected through `source_ip`. `trusted_cidrs` is required when `proxy_protocol = true` or `client_ip_headers` is set. Supported header names are `cf-connecting-ip`, `x-forwarded-for`, and `forwarded`. The same trusted-peer boundary controls whether forwarded HTTPS metadata affects redirects and upstream request headers.
- Written by the installer for server identity. Read by `tako-server` at startup.

**Server identity:** `tako-server` creates a stable Ed25519 identity at `{data_dir}/identity.key` and writes the public key to `{data_dir}/identity.pub`. The private key is mode `0600`, is preserved across restarts/upgrades, and is removed only by full server uninstall. `hello` and `server_info` include the OpenSSH SHA-256 fingerprint so the CLI can identify the server during add/probe flows.

**Remote management:** Remote management requires Tailscale so Tako can keep server control traffic private by default. Normal server installs configure `tako-server` to listen for private HTTP management traffic on port `9844` on the Tailscale address. The HTTP management API uses the same typed `Command -> Response` protocol as the Unix socket:

- `POST /rpc` with JSON command bodies handles small management commands.
- HTTP `/rpc` accepts unsigned `hello` and `server_info` probes. All other commands require a signed request from an enrolled SSH key. Requests include the enrolled key fingerprint, timestamp, nonce, and SSH signature over the RPC body plus Tako's management-auth context. Replayed nonces and stale timestamps are rejected.
- `POST /release-artifact` accepts deploy artifacts as a streamed request body. The request is signed over an upload descriptor containing app id, release version, byte size, and SHA-256 digest; the server verifies the received size and digest before extracting the release.
- `POST /logs` returns raw app log bytes with offset headers. The request is signed over app id,
  current/previous offsets, optional history cutoff, and byte limit.
- Signed HTTP commands reuse the existing dispatcher; bulk deploy artifacts and logs use dedicated
  byte-body endpoints instead of the JSON RPC path.
- The Unix management socket remains the local server IPC path. SSH remains setup/recovery, not the normal remote management transport.
- `tako servers add` expects the host to be the server's Tailscale MagicDNS name or Tailscale IP. MagicDNS hostnames default the local server name to the first DNS label; IP addresses require `--name`. It verifies the host resolves to a Tailscale address, verifies `tako@host` SSH recovery access, enrolls the SSH key that authenticated that connection, probes private HTTP management with `hello` and `server_info`, verifies signed HTTP access, and refuses to write `config.toml` if any check fails.
- App-scoped runtime commands (`deploy`, `status`, `logs`, `scale`, `releases`, `backups`, `delete`, and `secrets sync`) use signed HTTP remote management. SSH is not used for normal app/runtime management.

### Zero-Downtime Operation

- `tako servers reload` performs a zero-downtime control-plane reload by default (`systemctl reload tako-server` on systemd, `rc-service tako-server reload` on OpenRC). `--force` performs a full service restart instead.
- `tako servers upgrade` performs an in-place upgrade via service-manager reload (`systemctl reload tako-server` on systemd, `rc-service tako-server reload` on OpenRC) with root privileges (root login or sudo-capable user). Reload uses temporary process and listener overlap until the replacement process reports ready.
- Management socket uses a symlink-based path: the active server creates a PID-specific socket (`tako-{pid}.sock`) and atomically updates the `tako.sock` symlink on ready, so clients always connect to the current process.
- Restart/stop still honor graceful shutdown semantics from the host service manager (systemd or OpenRC as described above).

App log files contain app stdout/stderr plus app-scoped Tako server diagnostics. Each app keeps
`current.log` and the previous rotated file.

## Communication Protocol

### Unix Sockets

**tako-server socket:**

- Symlink path: `/var/run/tako/tako.sock` (always points to the active server socket)
- PID-specific socket path: `/var/run/tako/tako-{pid}.sock` (created by active server; symlink updated atomically on ready)
- Used by local server IPC and app/workflow internal commands. Normal remote CLI management uses signed HTTP.

**Remote management HTTP:**

- `tako-server` listens for management RPC over HTTP on port `9844` for Tailscale-reachable server status and deploy operations.
- Only `hello` and `server_info` are public probes. All other RPCs require SSH-key-signed headers, a fresh timestamp, and a non-replayed nonce against the server's `management-authorized-keys` file.
- Management RPC request bodies are capped at 1 MiB.
- Deploy artifact uploads use `POST /release-artifact`, signed over upload metadata rather than the full artifact body; the server verifies the streamed body size and SHA-256 digest before extracting it.
- Log reads use `POST /logs`, signed over request metadata and returned as raw bytes with cursor headers.

**Public proxy listeners:**

- `tako-server --http-port {port}` controls the public HTTP listener.
- `tako-server --https-port {port}` controls the public HTTPS listener.
- The installer owns these args in normal service installs; `tako servers add --install --http-port {port} --https-port {port}` passes them through to the remote installer.

**App instance upstream transport:**

- Native TCP over loopback
  - `tako-server` sets `PORT=0` and `HOST=127.0.0.1`; the SDK binds to an OS-assigned port
  - The SDK signals readiness by writing the bound port to fd 4
  - `tako-server` delivers the per-instance internal auth token on the fd 3 bootstrap envelope (see below); the SDK uses it for health-probe authentication
  - Used by: tako-server to proxy HTTP requests and probe health
- Container TCP over loopback
  - `tako-server` starts Podman with a server-assigned loopback host port published to container port `3000`
  - The container receives `HOST=0.0.0.0`, `PORT=3000`, and `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`
  - Readiness is the first successful SDK-authenticated response on the configured health path

### Environment Variables for Apps

Native HTTP instances and workflow workers receive the same app/runtime environment, except HTTP-only bind vars (`PORT`, `HOST`) and per-instance CLI args. Container HTTP instances receive the app/runtime environment plus `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`. In production, spawned native app and worker processes start from a cleared service environment; Tako preserves only minimal process env (`PATH`, `HOME` when available) before applying the app/runtime variables below.

| `TAKO_INTERNAL_SOCKET` | app + worker | Path to the shared internal unix socket for workflow enqueue/signal and channel publish | Set by both spawners. Together with `TAKO_APP_NAME` this must always be set as a pair; the SDK asserts this at boot.                                                 |
| `TAKO_DATA_DIR`        | app + worker | Persistent app-owned runtime data directory                                             | Set by Tako in dev, local `tako run`, and native deploys; points to the app's `data/app` directory. Not set for container releases in v0.                            |
| `TAKO_APP_ROOT`        | app + worker | JavaScript app root for `channels/` and `workflows/` discovery                          | Set for JS apps from `tako.toml` `app_root`; defaults to `src`.                                                                                                      |
| `NODE_ENV`             | app + worker | Node.js convention env                                                                  | Set by runtime adapter / server (`development` or `production`).                                                                                                     |
| `BUN_ENV`              | app + worker | Bun convention env                                                                      | Set by runtime adapter (`development` or `production`).                                                                                                              |
| `TAKO_BUILD`           | app + worker | Deployed build/version identifier                                                       | Written into release `app.json` by `tako deploy`; `tako-server` reads it from the manifest and passes it as an env var at spawn.                                     |
| _user-defined_         | app + worker | User config vars                                                                        | From `app.json` in the release dir. Native secrets + internal token pass via fd 3 bootstrap envelope. Container bootstrap data passes through `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`. |

**Instance identity (CLI args, not env vars):** `tako-server` passes per-instance identity to the SDK entrypoint as command-line arguments:

- `--instance <id>` — 8-character nanoid instance identifier

The SDK parses this from `process.argv` (JS) or `os.Args` (Go) at startup and exposes it through the internal status endpoint and health-check responses. Build/version identity comes from `TAKO_BUILD`.

**Bootstrap envelope (fd 3):** For native releases, `tako-server` opens a pipe on fd 3 of every spawned app and worker process. The pipe carries one JSON object:

```json
{
  "token": "<per-instance internal auth token>",
  "secrets": { "KEY": "value", ... },
  "storages": {
    "uploads": {
      "provider": "s3",
      "bucket": "app-uploads",
      "endpoint": "https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
      "region": "auto",
      "access_key_id": "<access key id>",
      "secret_access_key": "<secret access key>",
      "force_path_style": false,
      "public_base_url": "https://cdn.example.com/uploads"
    }
  }
}
```

The SDK checks fd 3 first at startup and closes it when present. For container processes, where fd 3 does not cross the container boundary in v0, and for local `tako run` scripts, the SDK falls back to the same envelope in `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA` and removes that variable from the process environment after startup. The token authenticates `Host: <app>.tako` requests (health probes, channel auth callbacks) when present. Secrets populate `tako.secrets`; storage bindings populate `tako.storages`. Backup storage is deliberately not included here unless the same resource is separately bound under `[envs.<env>].storages`. Generated `tako.d.ts` augments both project-specific surfaces. The fd 3 pipe is always present for native dev/prod processes — in dev mode with no secrets or storages, the envelope is `{"token": "...", "secrets": {}, "storages": {}}`.

### Messages (JSON over Unix Socket)

**CLI → tako-server (management commands):**

- `hello` (capabilities / protocol negotiation; CLI sends this before other commands):

```json
{ "command": "hello", "protocol_version": 0 }
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": {
    "protocol_version": 0,
    "server_version": "0.1.0",
    "capabilities": [
      "on_demand_cold_start",
      "idle_scale_to_zero",
      "scale",
      "upgrade_mode_control",
      "server_runtime_info",
      "release_history",
      "rollback",
      "backups"
    ],
    "server_identity": "SHA256:..."
  }
}
```

- `server_info` (returns runtime config + upgrade mode):

```json
{ "command": "server_info" }
```

- `enter_upgrading` / `exit_upgrading` (durable single-owner lock transitions):

```json
{ "command": "enter_upgrading", "owner": "upgrade-prod-..." }
```

```json
{ "command": "exit_upgrading", "owner": "upgrade-prod-..." }
```

- `prepare_release` (download runtime and install production dependencies for a release; called before `deploy` so that the deploy step only does app registration and instance startup):

```json
{
  "command": "prepare_release",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "path": "/opt/tako/apps/my-app/production/releases/1.0.0"
}
```

- `prepare_release_upload` (returns the server release path and whether the artifact needs to be uploaded):

```json
{
  "command": "prepare_release_upload",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

- `prepare_deploy` (validates and stages deploy metadata that must be checked from the server, including Cloudflare SSL credentials; called after artifact upload and before release preparation or release commands):

```json
{
  "command": "prepare_deploy",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "path": "/opt/tako/apps/my-app/production/releases/1.0.0",
  "routes": ["api.example.com", "*.example.com/admin/*"],
  "ssl": {
    "provider": "letsencrypt",
    "cloudflare_api_token": "..."
  }
}
```

- `cleanup_prepared_deploy` (clears staged deploy metadata after a failed deploy attempt without deleting the release artifact):

```json
{
  "command": "cleanup_prepared_deploy",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

- `cleanup_release` (removes a newly-created partial release after deploy failure):

```json
{
  "command": "cleanup_release",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

- `finalize_release` (points `current` at the deployed release and prunes old or excess releases):

```json
{
  "command": "finalize_release",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

- `check_deploy_space` (checks free bytes under the server data directory before artifact upload):

```json
{ "command": "check_deploy_space", "min_free_bytes": 268435456 }
```

- `deploy` (includes route patterns, source-IP mode, optional secrets payload, optional storage bindings, and SSL provider selection; env vars are read from `app.json` in the release dir). When `secrets` or `storages` are omitted or `null`, the server keeps existing values for the app. When Cloudflare credentials were staged by `prepare_deploy`, `deploy` references that staged binding by sending the same provider with `ssl.cloudflare_api_token` omitted. If no Cloudflare credential is required and `ssl.cloudflare_api_token` is absent or `null`, the server clears app SSL credentials:

```json
{
  "command": "deploy",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "path": "/opt/tako/apps/my-app/production/releases/1.0.0",
  "routes": ["api.example.com", "*.example.com/admin/*"],
  "source_ip": "direct",
  "secrets": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "...",
    "API_KEY": "..."
  },
  "storages": {
    "uploads": {
      "provider": "s3",
      "bucket": "my-app-prod",
      "endpoint": "https://example.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
      "region": "auto",
      "access_key_id": "...",
      "secret_access_key": "...",
      "force_path_style": false
    }
  },
  "ssl": {
    "provider": "cloudflare"
  },
  "backup": {
    "retention_days": 30,
    "backup_keys": [
      {
        "id": "backup-key-0123456789abcdef",
        "key_base64": "..."
      }
    ],
    "storage": {
      "provider": "s3",
      "bucket": "my-app-prod",
      "endpoint": "https://example.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
      "region": "auto",
      "access_key_id": "...",
      "secret_access_key": "...",
      "force_path_style": false
    }
  }
}
```

The `backup` field is optional. When present, the server stores the private backup target and backup encryption keys encrypted for that deployed app. When absent or `null`, the server clears backup configuration for the app.

- `backup_now`, `list_backups`, `backup_status`, `backup_download_url`, and `restore_backup`:

```json
{
  "command": "backup_now",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "backup": null
}
```

```json
{ "command": "list_backups", "app": "my-app/production" }
```

```json
{ "command": "backup_status", "app": "my-app/production" }
```

```json
{
  "command": "backup_download_url",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "backup_id": "b1710000000-AbCdEf12"
}
```

```json
{
  "command": "restore_backup",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "backup_id": "b1710000000-AbCdEf12"
}
```

`backup_now` stores the provided backup binding when present, then creates and uploads an encrypted private archive for the app's durable data on that server. `list_backups` reads the remote backup index. `backup_status` reports enabled/disabled state, retention, last backup, and next due time. `backup_download_url` returns a short-lived private archive URL. `restore_backup` stops the app on that server, verifies the encrypted archive SHA-256, decrypts it, replaces the app data tree, clears transient channel replay storage, reconciles workflows, and restarts according to the app's desired instance count.

- `scale` (updates the desired instance count for an app on one server):

```json
{ "command": "scale", "app": "my-app/production", "instances": 3 }
```

- `get_secrets_hash` (returns the SHA-256 hash of an app's current secrets; used by deploy to skip sending secrets when unchanged):

```json
{ "command": "get_secrets_hash", "app": "my-app/production" }
```

- `run_release` (run a one-shot release command on the leader server before rolling update):

```json
{
  "command": "run_release",
  "app": "my-app/production",
  "version": "abc1234",
  "path": "/opt/tako/apps/my-app/production/releases/abc1234",
  "command_line": "bun run db:migrate",
  "vars": {},
  "secrets": {}
}
```

The server validates the app name and release version, acquires the per-app deploy lock, derives base env from release `app.json`, overlays command `vars`, injects `TAKO_BUILD`, `TAKO_DATA_DIR`, and command `secrets`, then runs `sh -c "<command_line>"` in the release directory from a cleared service environment and the app's per-app Unix identity on root-managed production servers. Parent `PATH` is inserted only when the app/release env did not already provide it. Deploy sends the freshly decrypted secrets in the `run_release` payload so first deploys and secret rotations run against the same env the new HTTP instances will receive. Success returns exit metadata; non-zero exit or timeout returns an error response with a stderr tail.

Server-side validation on `deploy` and app-scoped commands:

- `app` is the deployment id used on the server. CLI app-scoped commands send `{app}/{env}`. Each segment must be normalized (`[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,62}` with no trailing `-`).
- `version` must be a simple release id (letters/digits/`.-_`, no path separators).
- `path` must resolve under `<data-dir>/apps/<app>/releases/`.

- `routes` (returns app → routes mapping used for conflict detection/debugging):

```json
{ "command": "routes" }
```

- `inject_challenge_token` (test/support command for HTTP-01 challenge serving):

```json
{ "command": "inject_challenge_token", "token": "abc", "key_authorization": "abc.123" }
```

- `list_releases` (returns release/build history for an app):

```json
{ "command": "list_releases", "app": "my-app/production" }
```

- `rollback` (roll back an app to a previous release/build id):

```json
{ "command": "rollback", "app": "my-app/production", "version": "abc1234" }
```

- `stop` (stop a running app):

```json
{ "command": "stop", "app": "my-app/production" }
```

- `status` (get status of a specific app):

```json
{ "command": "status", "app": "my-app/production" }
```

- `list` (list all deployed apps with their status):

```json
{ "command": "list" }
```

- `delete` (remove app state/routes):

```json
{ "command": "delete", "app": "my-app/production" }
```

- `update_secrets` (update secrets for a deployed app; refreshes workflow workers and triggers rolling restart):

```json
{ "command": "update_secrets", "app": "my-app/production", "secrets": { "KEY": "value" } }
```

**SDK/app → tako-server (internal socket commands):**

- From any Tako-managed app or worker process: `enqueue_run`, `signal`, and `channel_publish`.
- From workflow worker processes: `register_schedules`, `claim_run`, `heartbeat_run`, `save_step`, `complete_run`, `cancel_run`, `fail_run`, `defer_run`, and `wait_for_event`.
- Every internal command carries an `app` field so the shared internal socket can route commands for every deployed app.

**Instance communication model:**

- App and workflow worker processes run as the per-app Unix user for their deployed app id and do not connect to the management socket. The shared `tako-app` group is retained only for internal socket permissions. If a root `tako-server` cannot resolve or create the per-app identity, spawning fails closed instead of running app code as root.
- `tako-server` controls lifecycle directly (spawn/stop/rolling update). Startup readiness is signaled by the SDK via fd 4; ongoing health is verified via active HTTP probing.
- Native app processes receive `PORT=0` and `HOST=127.0.0.1`, bind to an OS-assigned loopback port, and write the actual port to fd 4. The server then routes traffic and health probes to that endpoint.
- Container app processes run through Podman with a server-assigned loopback host port published to container port `3000`. The container receives `HOST=0.0.0.0`, `PORT=3000`, and `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`; readiness is the first successful SDK-authenticated health probe.
- Secrets are passed to native instances via fd 3 (file descriptor 3) at spawn time. The server creates a pipe, writes the JSON bootstrap envelope to the write end, and the child process reads fd 3 at startup before any user code runs. EBADF on fd 3 means the process is not running under Tako (dev mode). Container instances receive the same envelope through `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`.
- Secret updates (`update_secrets` command) store new secrets in SQLite, drain/restart any workflow worker for the app, and trigger a rolling restart for HTTP instances; fresh native processes receive updated bootstrap data via fd 3 and fresh container instances receive it through `TAKO_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`.

### Health Checks

Active HTTP probing is the source of truth for instance health:

- **Probe interval**: 1 second steady-state, dropped to 100 ms while any instance is still in startup (Starting/Ready, not yet Healthy) or withheld from routing during rollout stability. The fast tier collapses cold-start and rollout probe slack from up to 1 s to ~100 ms without paying high-frequency probes at steady state.
- **Probe endpoint**: App's configured health check path (default: `/status`) with `Host: <app>.tako`, where `<app>` is the base app name (for example `dashboard.tako`)
- **Transport**: Probes use the instance's private TCP endpoint.
- **Process exit fast path**: Before each probe, `try_wait()` checks if the process has exited. If so, the instance is immediately marked dead without waiting for the probe timeout.
- **Failure threshold**: 1 failed probe is tolerated, 2 consecutive failures mark the instance unhealthy, and 3 consecutive failures mark it dead and trigger replacement. During rollout stability, a withheld replacement instance becomes unhealthy on the first failed probe so deploy can roll back before routing public traffic to it. A successful probe resets the failure count.
- **Recovery**: Single successful probe resets failure count and restores to healthy
- **Rollout stability**: During rolling update, new instances are not routed public traffic and old instances are not drained until every replacement batch stays healthy for 8 seconds. If active health probing marks a new batch unhealthy during that window, the deploy fails and rolls back.

#### Internal Probe Contract

Tako-server performs health checks against the deployed app process:

```
GET /status
Host: dashboard.tako
X-Tako-Internal-Token: <instance-token>
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "app": "dashboard",
  "version": "abc1234",
  "instance_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "pid": 12345,
  "uptime_seconds": 3600
}
```

The SDK wrappers implement this endpoint automatically. The edge proxy does not reserve or bypass `Host: <app>.tako` routes.
The expected response includes the same `X-Tako-Internal-Token` header value. The SDK wrappers enforce and echo this token automatically.

Container health checks use the same health path, host header, and internal token echo as native releases.

### Prometheus Metrics

Tako-server exposes a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint for observability.

**Endpoint:** `http://127.0.0.1:9898/` (localhost only, not publicly accessible)

**CLI flag:** `--metrics-port <port>` (default: 9898, set to 0 to disable request/upstream metrics collection and the endpoint)

**Exposed metrics:**

| Metric                                   | Type      | Labels                      | Description                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tako_http_requests_total`               | Counter   | `server`, `app`, `status`   | Total proxied requests, grouped by status class (2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx)                                         |
| `tako_http_request_duration_seconds`     | Histogram | `server`, `app`             | End-to-end proxy request latency distribution                                                             |
| `tako_upstream_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `server`, `app`             | Upstream-only latency (proxy → origin → response headers); subtract from end-to-end to get proxy overhead |
| `tako_http_active_connections`           | Gauge     | `server`, `app`             | Currently active connections                                                                              |
| `tako_cold_starts_total`                 | Counter   | `server`, `app`             | Total cold starts triggered (scale-to-zero apps)                                                          |
| `tako_cold_start_duration_seconds`       | Histogram | `server`, `app`             | Cold start duration distribution (records on success and failure)                                         |
| `tako_cold_start_failures_total`         | Counter   | `server`, `app`, `reason`   | Cold start failures by reason (`spawn_failed`, `instance_dead`)                                           |
| `tako_tls_handshake_failures_total`      | Counter   | `server`, `reason`          | TLS handshake failures by reason (`no_sni`, `cert_missing`)                                               |
| `tako_instance_health`                   | Gauge     | `server`, `app`, `instance` | Instance health status (1=healthy, 0=unhealthy)                                                           |
| `tako_instances_running`                 | Gauge     | `server`, `app`             | Number of running instances                                                                               |

All metrics carry a `server` label (machine hostname) so multi-server deployments are distinguishable without scraper-side relabeling. A single scrape returns data for all deployed apps on that server.

Only proxied requests (routed to a backend) are measured for the request/upstream histograms. ACME challenges, direct static asset responses, and unmatched-host 404s are excluded. `tako_tls_handshake_failures_total` only tracks Tako-visible reasons (missing SNI, cert lookup miss); raw TLS protocol failures inside Pingora's listener are not counted.

**Usage with monitoring platforms:**

- **Self-hosted Prometheus/Grafana**: Add `127.0.0.1:9898` as a scrape target.
- **Hosted platforms (Grafana Cloud, Datadog, etc.)**: Install the platform's agent on the server, configure it to scrape `http://127.0.0.1:9898/metrics`.
- **Tailscale/WireGuard**: Expose port 9898 on the private network interface for remote scraping.

The endpoint uses Pingora's built-in Prometheus server with gzip compression.

## TLS/SSL Certificates

### SNI-Based Certificate Selection

Tako-server uses SNI (Server Name Indication) to select the appropriate certificate during TLS handshake:

1. Client connects and sends SNI hostname
2. Server looks up certificate for that hostname in CertManager
3. If exact match found, use that certificate
4. If no exact match, try wildcard fallback (e.g., `api.example.com` → `*.example.com`)
5. If still no match, serve fallback default certificate so HTTPS can complete and routing can return normal HTTP status codes (for example `404` for unknown routes/hosts)

This requires OpenSSL (not rustls) for callback support.

### Automatic Management

- Let’s Encrypt ACME by default, or Cloudflare Origin CA when an environment sets `ssl = "cloudflare"`
- Automatic issuance for domains in app routes
- For private/local route hostnames (`localhost`, `*.localhost`, single-label hosts, and reserved suffixes such as `*.local`, `*.test`, `*.invalid`, `*.example`, `*.home.arpa`), Tako skips ACME and generates a self-signed certificate during deploy.
- If no certificate exists yet for an SNI hostname, Tako serves a fallback self-signed default certificate so TLS handshakes still complete.
- Automatic renewal 30 days before expiry
- HTTP-01 challenge uses the public HTTP port. Let's Encrypt reaches port 80, so custom HTTP ports require external port-80 forwarding, DNS-01, or manual certificates.
- Zero-downtime renewal
- DNS-01 challenges are supported for Let’s Encrypt certificates through Cloudflare DNS. Set up encrypted provider credentials with `tako credentials set ssl.cloudflare --env <env>`. Use a Cloudflare user or account API token with Zone Read and DNS Write for the matching zone. Deploy rejects missing or expired credentials for wildcard routes, warns when they expire within 30 days, verifies Cloudflare DNS zone access from each target server during remote prepare, stages the SSL binding for the final deploy command, and `tako-server` stores it encrypted per deployed app. Exact routes use DNS-01 when this credential is present; otherwise they use HTTP-01.
- Cloudflare SSL uses Cloudflare Origin CA. Set `ssl = "cloudflare"` in `tako.toml` and set up encrypted provider credentials with `tako credentials set ssl.cloudflare --env <env>`. Use a Cloudflare user or account API token with Zone / SSL and Certificates / Edit for the matching zone. Deploy rejects missing or expired credentials, warns when they expire within 30 days, validates supported user-owned Cloudflare tokens from each target server during remote prepare, stages the SSL binding for the final deploy command, and `tako-server` stores it encrypted per deployed app. Account-owned Cloudflare tokens are accepted and validated by Origin CA API calls during certificate issuance.

### Wildcard Certificate Handling

Routing supports wildcard hosts (e.g. `*.example.com`). For TLS:

- Let’s Encrypt wildcard certificates are issued automatically via Cloudflare DNS-01 challenges when the deployed app environment has unexpired `ssl.cloudflare` credentials stored by `tako credentials`; exact Let’s Encrypt certificates also use DNS-01 when the credential is present. Each target server verifies the token can read the matching Cloudflare zone during remote prepare, the token must allow DNS Write for issuance, and deploy warns when those credentials expire within 30 days
- Cloudflare SSL wildcard certificates are issued through Cloudflare Origin CA and do not require DNS-01 credentials
- Wildcard certificates are used when present in cert storage
- If Let’s Encrypt wildcard routes are deployed without Cloudflare credentials, deploy fails with an error directing the user to run `tako credentials set ssl.cloudflare --env <env>`

### Certificate Storage

```
/opt/tako/certs/{domain}/
├── fullchain.pem      # Certificate + intermediates
└── privkey.pem        # Private key (0600 permissions)
```

### Development

Pass `--acme-staging` to `tako-server` to use Let's Encrypt staging:

- No rate limits
- Unlimited certificate issuance
- Certificates not trusted by browsers
- Perfect for development/testing

## SDKs

### JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

#### Installation

```bash
npm install tako.sh
```

#### Interface

Apps export a Web Standard fetch handler:

```typescript
export default function fetch(request: Request): Response | Promise<Response> {
  return new Response("Hello!");
}
```

### Runtime context (`tako.sh` + `tako.d.ts`)

Tako v0 does not install any global. App code imports runtime state from `tako.sh`; `tako generate` emits a project-local `tako.d.ts` file that augments `tako.sh` with project-specific environment names, secret keys, storage bindings, channel metadata, workflow metadata, and user-defined env var names for `process.env` / `import.meta.env`. Tako-owned runtime values are typed through `tako.sh` exports such as `tako.env`, `tako.build`, and `tako.dataDir`, not through generated env-var globals. The declaration file keeps an existing `app/`, `src/`, or root location, otherwise uses an existing legacy `tako.gen.ts` location, then `app/`, then `src/`, then the project root. App code does not import the generated file:

```typescript
import { tako } from "tako.sh";

tako.logger.info("boot", { env: tako.env, build: tako.build });
const dbUrl = tako.secrets.DATABASE_URL;
```

| Export         | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tako`         | Frozen runtime object containing app state, logger, secrets, and storage bindings                                      |
| `env`          | `ENV` value (`"development"`, `"production"`, ...); also available as `tako.env`                                       |
| `isDev`        | `true` when `env === "development"`; also available as `tako.isDev`                                                    |
| `isProd`       | `true` when `env === "production"`; also available as `tako.isProd`                                                    |
| `port`         | Port assigned to this app instance; also available as `tako.port`                                                      |
| `host`         | Host/address Tako bound this app instance to; also available as `tako.host`                                            |
| `build`        | Build identifier injected at deploy time (`"dev"` under `tako dev`); also available as `tako.build`                    |
| `dataDir`      | Persistent app-owned data directory — writes survive restarts; also available as `tako.dataDir`                        |
| `appDir`       | Directory the app is running from (equivalent to `process.cwd()`); also available as `tako.appDir`                     |
| `secrets`      | Typed secret bag — redacts automatically on bulk serialize; also available as `tako.secrets`                           |
| `storages`     | Typed storage binding bag; also available as `tako.storages`                                                           |
| `tako.cache`   | SQLite-backed key/value cache helper                                                                                   |
| `logger`       | Structured JSON logger (`logger.info(...)`) bound to `source: "app"`; also available as `tako.logger`                  |
| `Env`          | TypeScript union of environment names declared in `tako.toml`, narrows `tako.env === "staging"` checks at compile time |
| `TakoSecrets`  | TypeScript interface of secret keys declared in `.tako/secrets.json`                                                   |
| `TakoStorages` | TypeScript interface of storage binding names declared in `tako.toml`                                                  |
| `TakoRuntime`  | TypeScript type of the `tako` runtime object                                                                           |

`tako.secrets` redacts automatically on `JSON.stringify`, `console.log`, and `toString` (returns `"[REDACTED]"`); individual key access (`tako.secrets.MY_KEY`) returns the value. The generated `TakoSecrets` augmentation is regenerated from `.tako/secrets.json` on every `tako dev`, `tako deploy`, `tako generate`, and `tako secrets` change. Generation prefers secret names from the `development` environment when present, then falls back to the union of all secret environments.

`tako.storages` exposes storage bindings delivered through the bootstrap envelope. Individual storage access (`tako.storages.uploads`) returns an object with `createDownloadUrl`, `createUploadUrl`, `createImageUrl`, and `createImageSrcSet`. The generated `TakoStorages` augmentation is regenerated from `tako.toml` on `tako dev`, `tako deploy`, and `tako generate`.

`tako.cache` provides a server-side key/value cache for JSON-serializable values. `tako.cache.get<T>(key)` returns `T | undefined`; missing and expired keys return `undefined`. `tako.cache.put(key, value, { ttl })` stores a value with a TTL in milliseconds. `tako.cache.delete(key)` removes one key. Native dev and deploy runtimes store cache entries in local SQLite at `{data_dir}/apps/{app}/{env}/data/tako/cache.sqlite`; cache storage is transient and is not included in app data backups. Container releases do not receive `TAKO_DATA_DIR` in v0, so the cache helper is unavailable there.

Channels and workflows are not on the runtime context — they are regular ES modules you import from their files:

```typescript
import sendEmail from "../workflows/send-email";
import chat from "../channels/chat";

await sendEmail.enqueue({ to: "u@e.co" });
await chat({ roomId: "r1" }).publish({ type: "msg", data: { text: "hi" } });
```

The `tako.sh` package exports `tako`, `imageUrl`, `imageSrcSet`, `defineChannel`, `defineWorkflow`, `signal`, `TakoError`, `InferChannel`, and `InferWorkflowPayload`. Storage URL option types are exported from `tako.sh`. The `tako.sh/runtime` subpath is reserved for browser-safe runtime internals. Server-adapter plumbing (`handleTakoEndpoint`, `initServerRuntime`, and the channel/workflow definition types) lives under `tako.sh/internal` and is intended for framework adapters. The `Channel` class is not exported from `tako.sh`: code uses the accessor returned by `defineChannel(...).$messageTypes<M>()` from the matching `<app_root>/channels/` file. Browser code imports `Channel` and `configureChannels` from `tako.sh/client`; React channel hooks remain available from `tako.sh/react`. There is no `Tako` global.

### Go SDK

#### Installation

```bash
go get tako.sh
```

#### Interface

Go apps use the `tako` package to serve an `http.Handler`:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "tako.sh"
)

func main() {
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        w.Write([]byte("Hello from Tako!"))
    })
    tako.ListenAndServe(mux)
}
```

For frameworks that manage their own server (e.g. Fiber on fasthttp), use `tako.Listener()` to get a pre-bound `net.Listener` instead.

#### Key Differences from JS SDK

- Go compiles to a native binary — no runtime download needed on the server.
- The compiled binary runs directly (`launch_args: ["{main}"]`), no SDK entrypoint wrapper. The `tako` package wires up the protocol from inside the user's own binary.
- `tako.ListenAndServe()` handles the full protocol: CLI arg parsing (`--instance`), TCP serving, `Host: <app>.tako` endpoint interception, graceful shutdown on `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` with a 10s drain window.
- Deploy auto-injects `GOOS=linux` and `GOARCH` for cross-compilation to the target server.
- Default build: `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o app .` producing a static HTTP binary. When `cmd/worker/main.go` exists, the default build also runs `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o worker ./cmd/worker` and the deploy manifest records `workflow_worker_main = "worker"` so `tako-server` can supervise the worker subprocess.
- In `tako dev`, a Go project with `cmd/worker/main.go` runs workflows through `go run ./cmd/worker` as a separate scale-to-zero worker subprocess.
- Secrets: `tako.GetSecret("name")` provides access to Tako-managed secrets. Run `tako generate` to generate a typed `Secrets` struct in `tako_secrets.go`.

### Rust SDK

#### Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
tako = "0.1"
```

#### Axum

Rust apps use the `tako` crate to bind through Tako and install the internal status handler:

```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(|| async { "Hello from Tako" }));
    tako::axum::serve(app).await
}
```

For frameworks that own their server loop, use `tako::std_listener()` or `tako::listener().await` with the `tokio` feature. Secrets are available through `tako::secret("NAME")` or `tako::bootstrap()?.secret("NAME")`. Container and native releases use the same SDK API; only the bootstrap transport changes.

### Vite Plugin

```typescript
import { tako } from "tako.sh/vite";
```

- `tako.sh/vite` provides a plugin that prepares a deploy entry wrapper in Vite output.
- It emits `<outDir>/tako-entry.mjs`, which normalizes the compiled server module to a default-exported fetch handler.
- During `vite dev`, it adds `.test`, `.tako.test`, and configured dev route hostnames to `server.allowedHosts`.
- During `vite dev`, when `PORT` is set, it binds Vite to `127.0.0.1:$PORT` with `strictPort: true`.
- During `tako dev`, it reads the fd 3 bootstrap before server code runs so Vite SSR can access `tako.secrets` and `tako.storages`.
- During `tako dev`, it routes Vite-process `console.*`, stdout, and stderr through structured Tako app log events so multi-line framework/runtime errors stay grouped in the CLI log stream.
- Deploy does not read Vite metadata files.
- To use the generated wrapper as deploy entry, set `main` in `tako.toml` to the generated file (for example `dist/server/tako-entry.mjs`) or define preset top-level `main`.

### Next.js Adapter

```typescript
import { withTako } from "tako.sh/nextjs";
```

- `tako.sh/nextjs` provides `withTako()`, a helper that sets `output = "standalone"`, points `adapterPath` at the installed Tako adapter, and appends `"*.test"` and `"*.tako.test"` to `allowedDevOrigins` so `next dev` accepts requests from Tako's dev hostnames.
- `withTako()` configures `next/image` to use Tako's public optimizer globally by setting `images.loader = "custom"` and `images.loaderFile` to Tako's packaged loader. It also aligns Next's generated image widths with Tako's public optimizer defaults by setting `images.deviceSizes = [320, 640, 960, 1200, 1920]` and `images.imageSizes = []`.
- On build, the adapter writes `.next/tako-entry.mjs`.
- If Next emits `.next/standalone/server.js`, the adapter copies `public/` and `.next/static/` into `.next/standalone/` so that standalone server can serve them.
- If standalone output is not emitted, the generated wrapper falls back to `next start` against the built `.next/` directory and installed `next` package.
- The generated `tako-entry.mjs` exports a fetch handler that proxies requests to the standalone `server.js`.

### Feature Overview

- Internal fetch handler adapters for Bun/Node runtimes (used by entrypoint binaries)
- Go SDK with `tako.ListenAndServe()` for native http.Handler support
- Rust SDK with bootstrap helpers, listener binding, and `tako::axum::serve(router)` for Axum apps
- Deployed app serving over private TCP with `PORT`/`HOST`; `tako dev` also uses TCP (`PORT`)
- Internal status endpoint (`Host: <app>.tako` + `/status`)
- Internal channel auth endpoint (`Host: <app>.tako` + `POST /channels/authorize`)
- Internal channel registry endpoint (`Host: <app>.tako` + `GET /channels/registry`)
- Internal WebSocket dispatch endpoint (`Host: <app>.tako` + `POST /channels/dispatch`)
- Public durable channel read/connect route at `GET /_tako/channels/<name>`
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Built-in Endpoints

**`GET /status` with `Host: <app>.tako`**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "app": "dashboard",
  "version": "abc1234",
  "instance_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "pid": 12345,
  "uptime_seconds": 3600
}
```

Used for health checks during rolling updates and monitoring.

**`POST /channels/authorize` with `Host: <app>.tako`**

Used by `tako-server` to ask the app SDK whether a channel operation is allowed and which lifecycle settings apply. The SDK returns `ok`, optional `subject`, optional `transport`, and channel lifecycle settings such as `replayWindowMs`, `inactivityTtlMs`, `keepaliveIntervalMs`, and `maxConnectionLifetimeMs`.

**`GET /channels/registry` with `Host: <app>.tako`**

Used by `tako-server` to fetch the app's declared channel metadata for validation, auth, and transport selection.

**`POST /channels/dispatch` with `Host: <app>.tako`**

Used by `tako-server` to dispatch incoming WebSocket frames to the app's declared channel handler before fan-out.

### Channels

Durable channels are Tako-owned pub-sub routes for app events:

- `GET /_tako/channels/<name>` with `Accept: text/event-stream` serves SSE with replay + live tail
- `GET /_tako/channels/<name>` with `Upgrade: websocket` upgrades to WebSocket

Every channel publish is stored before delivery. Channels are broadcast streams, not work queues: all authorized subscribers to the same channel read the same messages, and each subscriber keeps its own cursor. A message is not claimed or removed when one subscriber receives it. In production, the replay log is scoped to the deployed app id (`{name}/{env}`), not to a release or instance. Single-server environments without `postgres_url` use local SQLite. Environments with `postgres_url` use Postgres schema `tako_channels`, so every server reads the same replay log and publishes from any server are visible to subscribers connected to any other server. In local dev, replay is per registered app and in-memory for the current daemon process. The log is bounded by `replayWindowMs`, which defaults to 10 minutes. Apps that need canonical history still store it in their own database and use channel replay as the reconnect bridge.

- SSE resumes from `Last-Event-ID`
- WebSocket resumes from `last_message_id` in the query string
- If no cursor is provided, Tako starts from the latest retained message
- If the requested cursor is older than the retained replay window, Tako returns `410 Gone`

Browser clients keep reconnecting until explicitly closed. Network loss, laptop sleep, server restarts, and clean connection rotation are treated as transient disconnects: the SDK retries with bounded exponential backoff and jitter, wakes early when the browser reports it is back online, and resumes from the last received message id.

Channel WebSocket transport uses JSON text frames:

- server-to-client text frames are serialized `ChannelMessage` objects
- client-to-server text frames are parsed as `ChannelPublishPayload` objects, routed through the channel's declared `handler`, and the handler's return value is fanned out to subscribers
- client-to-server frame payloads are capped at 128 MiB, matching the proxy request body limit

Channel routes are exact and flat: `defineChannel("chat", ...)` is served at `/_tako/channels/chat`. Dynamic values are query params validated against the channel's declared JSON Schema, for example `/_tako/channels/chat?roomId=room-123`.

### Authoring channels

**JS/TypeScript** — file-based discovery: drop a file into `<app_root>/channels/*.ts` with a default export of `defineChannel("<name>", ...).$messageTypes<M>()`. The first argument is the wire channel name and is the source of truth for the public route. Generated/scaffolded files use the file stem as the initial name, but users may choose a different explicit name; discovery rejects duplicate declared names. Generated `TakoChannels` metadata uses the declared channel name as its key and `import("tako.sh").InferChannel<typeof import("./channels/<file>").default>` to infer params, messages, and transport from the channel export. `paramsSchema` is a TypeBox schema that becomes both the TypeScript params type and the server-side JSON Schema used by `tako-server` before app auth. `.$messageTypes<M>()` is a type-level narrower that declares the message map; at runtime it returns the same export.

```ts
// <app_root>/channels/chat.ts
import { defineChannel } from "tako.sh";

type ChatMessages = {
  msg: { text: string; userId: string };
  typing: { userId: string };
};

export default defineChannel("chat", {
  paramsSchema: (t) => t.Object({ roomId: t.String({ minLength: 1 }) }),
  auth: {
    headerName: "authorization",
    async verify(input) {
      const session = await readSession(input.header);
      if (!session) return false;
      const allowed = await db.isMember(input.params.roomId, session.userId);
      return allowed ? { subject: session.userId } : false;
    },
  },
  handler: {
    msg: async (data, ctx) => {
      await db.saveMessage(ctx.params.roomId, data);
      return data; // what gets fanned out to subscribers
    },
    typing: async (data) => data,
  },
}).$messageTypes<ChatMessages>();
```

- **`paramsSchema`** — optional TypeBox schema. Omit it for channels with no params. The serialized JSON Schema is sent to `tako-server`, which rejects invalid query params before round-tripping to the app.
- **`auth`** — optional. Omit or set `false` for public channels. Auth is declarative: `{ headerName, cookieName, verify }`. `headerName` defaults to `authorization`; set it to `false` for cookie-only auth. `verify(input)` receives `{ header?, cookie?, params, channel, operation }` and returns `false`, `true`, or `{ subject }`.
- **`handler`** — optional map keyed by message type. Presence of `handler` makes the channel a **WebSocket** channel (bidirectional); absence makes it **SSE** (broadcast-only). Each handler returns the data to broadcast, or `void` / `undefined` to drop the message.
- **`replayWindowMs`** — retained replay window for reconnecting clients. Defaults to 10 minutes. Set `0` to keep messages until manual database maintenance.
- **`inactivityTtlMs`** — optional idle-channel cleanup window. Defaults to off.
- **`keepaliveIntervalMs`** — SSE/WS heartbeat cadence. Defaults to 25 seconds.
- **`maxConnectionLifetimeMs`** — maximum lifetime for a single connection. Defaults to 2 hours.

**Transport inference:**

- `handler` present → **WS**. Clients can send over the socket; each frame routes through the declared handler; the return value fans out to subscribers. Handler errors or `void` returns drop the message. Types not in the handler map pass through without server processing.
- `handler` absent → **SSE**. Broadcast-only. Server publishes via the imported channel module (`await missionLog({ base }).publish(...)`); clients only receive.

WebSocket header auth is sent as the first text frame:

```json
{ "type": "tako.auth", "token": "Bearer ...", "lastMessageId": "123" }
```

Browser clients may pass `authorization: token` to `Channel.subscribe`, `Channel.connect`, or `useChannel` to send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for header-auth channels. The option is optional; omit it for public channels and cookie-auth channels. `headers.Authorization` remains available for explicit authorization values.

If an auth-required WebSocket does not send a valid first frame within five seconds, `tako-server` closes it with an errkit-generated app close code.

**Go** — programmatic registration mirrors the same wire protocol:

```go
tako.Channels.Register("chat", tako.ChannelDefinition{
  ParamsSchema: []byte(`{"type":"object","properties":{"roomId":{"type":"string"}},"required":["roomId"]}`),
  Auth: &tako.ChannelAuthScheme{HeaderName: "authorization"},
  Verify: func(input tako.VerifyInput) tako.ChannelAuthDecision {
    if input.Header == nil || input.Header.Scheme != "Bearer" {
      return tako.RejectChannel()
    }
    return tako.AllowChannel(tako.ChannelGrant{Subject: "user-123"})
  },
})
```

### Publishing from the server

Server-side code (HTTP handlers, workflow bodies) imports a channel module directly and calls it. Unparameterized channels expose `publish` / `subscribe` / `connect` on the export; parameterized ones are callable with their params, returning the same handle:

```ts
// <app_root>/channels/status.ts (unparameterized)
import status from "../channels/status";
await status.publish({ type: "ping", data: { at: Date.now() } });

// <app_root>/channels/mission-log.ts (parameterized by paramsSchema)
import missionLog from "../channels/mission-log";
await missionLog({ base }).publish({ type: "event", data: event });
```

Params are URL-encoded automatically. `publish` payloads are type-checked against the message map declared via `.$messageTypes<M>()`. The `Channel` class is not re-exported from `tako.sh` — browser code imports it from `tako.sh/client` (or uses the `useChannel` hook from `tako.sh/react`).

## Workflows (Durable Runs)

Tako's workflow engine runs durable background work alongside an app's HTTP
instances — retries with exponential backoff, delayed/cron schedules, and
multi-step workflows whose progress survives process restarts via `ctx.run`
checkpoints. It positions Tako for the "backend of your backend" use case
(image processing, email, reindexing, LLM calls) without requiring a separate
queue service.

**Vocabulary:**

- **workflow** — a named handler (the file in `<app_root>/workflows/*.ts`, or a
  registered handler in the Go worker binary).
- **run** — one execution of a workflow (the row in the queue that gets
  claimed, retried, completed, or moved to dead).
- **step** — a memoized portion inside a run via `ctx.run(name, fn)`.

### Architecture

- **Storage**: local mode uses `{tako_data_dir}/apps/<app>/data/tako/workflows.sqlite` with WAL. Remote mode uses Postgres schema `tako_workflows`. tako-server is the only process that reads/writes either backend; SDKs reach it exclusively via the shared internal unix socket.
- **Tables**:
  - `runs` — one row per run (status, attempts, lease, payload).
  - `steps` — one row per completed step `(run_id, name, result)`. First-write-wins via `INSERT OR IGNORE` so duplicate saves after a retried RPC don't overwrite.
  - `event_waiters` — runs parked on `ctx.waitFor`, indexed by `event_name` for fast lookup on `signal`.
  - `schedules`, `leader_leases` — cron infrastructure.
- **tako-server (Rust)** — owns the DB, exposes the internal unix socket, runs the cron ticker, dispatches runnable work, and supervises the worker subprocess. `EnqueueRun` returns after the run is committed to SQLite; worker startup is a separate dispatch step. The dispatcher coalesces enqueue/signal/cron/reclaim notifications and scans for due pending runs every second, waking a worker only when `status='pending' AND run_at <= now`. The ticker also calls `reclaim_expired()` every second: any run stuck in `status='running'` past its `lease_until` is moved back to `pending`, and the dispatcher wakes a fresh worker when it is runnable. This is how runs recover from a worker that died mid-execution (SIGKILL, OOM, host crash, server-level restart without graceful drain).
- **Worker process (JS or Go)** — loads user code, claims runs, executes handlers. Separate from HTTP instances so heavy workflow deps don't bloat the request-serving process.
- **SDK** — each workflow module's default export provides `.enqueue(payload, opts?)`; `signal(event, payload?)` is a top-level export from `tako.sh` that throws `TakoError("TAKO_UNAVAILABLE")` when called outside an installed workflow runtime. Workers use the same RPC client for claim/heartbeat/save/complete/cancel/fail/defer/wait. **No SQLite in any SDK.**

### Configuration (tako.toml)

```toml
[workflows]                   # base config inherited by every worker group
workers = 1
concurrency = 10

[workflows.email]             # named worker-group override
run = ["./worker", "email"]
workers = 2

[servers.lax.workflows]       # base override on one server
workers = 2

[servers.lax.workflows.email] # named worker-group override on one server
workers = 4
```

Fields:

- **`run`** — command used to start this workflow worker group when the runtime needs an explicit worker process command. In v0, container releases support one configured workflow `run` command across `[workflows]` and named workflow groups; declaring more than one is rejected during deploy packaging.
- **`workers`** — number of always-on worker processes. `0` = scale-to-zero: tako-server starts a worker when runnable workflow work appears from enqueue, signal, cron, delayed retry/sleep, or lease reclaim. The worker exits after it has been idle (no claimed runs) long enough for the supervisor's idle window. Default `0`.
- **`concurrency`** — max parallel runs per worker. Default `10`.

Precedence for unnamed workflows: built-in defaults (`workers = 0`, `concurrency = 10`) < `[workflows]` < `[servers.<name>.workflows]`.

Precedence for `worker: "email"`: built-in defaults < `[workflows]` < `[workflows.email]` < `[servers.<name>.workflows]` < `[servers.<name>.workflows.email]`. A top-level `workers = 5` under `[workflows]` is inherited by each worker group unless that group overrides it.

If a JS app has a `<app_root>/workflows/` directory (or a Go app declares a worker binary) but no workflow config anywhere, the app is implicitly scale-to-zero on every server in the env.

### Authoring workflows

**JS/TypeScript** — file-based discovery: drop a file into `<app_root>/workflows/<name>.ts` with a default export from `defineWorkflow<P>(name, opts)`. The `opts.handler` function's second argument is the workflow context (`ctx`) — call `ctx.run`/`ctx.sleep`/`ctx.waitFor`/`ctx.bail`/`ctx.fail` as needed, use `ctx.logger` for workflow-scoped logs, and read `ctx.runId` / `ctx.workflowName` / `ctx.attempt` (the 1-indexed run attempt, bumped on each run-level retry) for context:

```ts
// <app_root>/workflows/send-email.ts
import { defineWorkflow } from "tako.sh";

type SendEmailPayload = { userId: string };

export default defineWorkflow<SendEmailPayload>("send-email", {
  retries: 4,
  schedule: "0 9 * * *",
  handler: async (payload, ctx) => {
    ctx.logger.info("send-email started");
    const user = await ctx.run("fetch-user", (step) => {
      step.logger.info("fetching user");
      return db.users.find(payload.userId);
    });
    await ctx.run("send", (step) => {
      step.logger.info("sending email");
      return mailer.send(user.email);
    });
  },
}); // 9am daily
```

The `name` is required (it must be a string literal — codegen and the dedup/cron systems read it) and should match the filename for the file-based discovery scan.

On worker startup, the SDK registers the complete current cron schedule set for the discovered workflows. Missing schedules are deregistered, including the case where workflows still exist but none define `schedule`.

Set `worker: "name"` in the workflow opts to assign a workflow to a named worker group; workflows without `worker` belong to the `default` group. Worker processes launched with `TAKO_WORKFLOW_WORKER=<name>` load only workflows assigned to that group. Worker processes without `TAKO_WORKFLOW_WORKER` load all workflows for compatibility with the default single-worker deployment path.

Set `local: true` in the workflow opts to force that workflow onto per-server local SQLite storage. In multi-server environments, deploy uses shared Postgres workflow storage when `postgres_url` is set; otherwise every JS workflow source file must opt into `local: true` or deploy fails before build/deploy work starts. Local cron schedules run once per server and local enqueue uniqueness is scoped to each server. Channels do not have a local opt-out for multi-server deploys because channel publish/replay must reach subscribers connected to every server.

**Go** — explicit registration in a separate `cmd/worker/main.go` binary. Go's separate-binary design is intentional: a single-binary design would link workflow dependencies (image libraries, ML bindings, mail clients, queue integrations) into the HTTP server binary.

The HTTP app remains the default Go package and serves through `tako.ListenAndServe()`:

```text
main.go
cmd/worker/main.go
```

`tako dev` runs the HTTP process with `go run .` and starts the workflow process with `go run ./cmd/worker` when that file exists. `tako deploy` builds the HTTP binary to `app` and the worker binary to `worker`; `app.json` records `workflow_worker_main = "worker"` so `tako-server` supervises that worker as a separate scale-to-zero subprocess.

### Enqueuing

```ts
// anywhere:
import sendEmail from "../workflows/send-email";

await sendEmail.enqueue({ userId: "u1" });
await sendEmail.enqueue(payload, {
  runAt: new Date(Date.now() + 60_000),
  retries: 9,
  uniqueKey: "daily-digest:2026-04-14",
});
```

Each workflow module's default export is a typed handle: `.enqueue(payload, opts?)` is constrained to the payload type declared on `defineWorkflow<P>(name, opts)`. No generated file is needed for workflow enqueue typing — it flows from the module's own types.

`uniqueKey` deduplicates: if an existing non-terminal run has the same key, enqueue is a no-op and returns the existing run's id. Cron ticks use this internally (key = `cron:<name>:<bucket_ms>`) so catching up doesn't double-enqueue.

### Step checkpointing

`ctx.run(name, fn, opts?)` persists `fn`'s return value as one row in the `steps` table keyed by `(run_id, name)`. On retry, previously-completed steps return their stored value instead of re-executing. The step callback receives a step context (`step`) with `step.logger` scoped to the workflow and step name, plus `step.runId`, `step.workflowName`, `step.stepName`, and `step.attempt`.

Per-step options:

- `retries: N` — in-step retry budget (default 0). After N+1 in-step attempts the error propagates → run-level retry kicks in.
- `backoff: { base, max }` — between in-step retries.
- `retry: false` — short-circuit: any throw fails the run immediately, skipping both in-step and run-level retries.

### At-least-once contract

If the worker crashes between `fn` returning and the SaveStep RPC completing, `fn` runs again on the next claim. The window is one RPC (~1ms) but it's real. **Make step bodies idempotent**: Stripe idempotency keys, `db.users.upsert` not `create`, dedup keys on outbound webhooks. This contract matches every workflow engine in the industry — it's the cost of durability without two-phase commit.

### Durable `ctx.sleep`

`ctx.sleep(name, ms)` waits until the wake time. Short waits (< 30s) run inline; longer waits **defer the run** via `DeferRun` — the worker exits the handler, the run goes back to `pending` with `run_at = wakeAt`, and the dispatcher wakes a worker once the run is due. Crash-safe across days.

### Events: `signal` / `waitFor`

`ctx.waitFor(name, { timeout })` parks the run waiting for a named event. The handler exits, the run goes to `pending` with no `run_at`, an `event_waiters` row is inserted, and the worker can release.

`signal(name, payload?)` from `tako.sh` (or the equivalent internal-socket call in Go) wakes every parked waiter with matching name. The payload is materialized as the waiter's step result, the run is set runnable, and the dispatcher wakes a worker if needed. `signal` is runtime-guarded: calling it from browser code (where the workflow runtime is not installed) throws a `TakoError("TAKO_UNAVAILABLE")` instead of silently no-oping.

```ts
// Worker handler — pause until approval arrives
const decision = await ctx.waitFor<{ approved: boolean }>(`approval:order-${payload.id}`, {
  timeout: 7 * 24 * 3600 * 1000,
});
if (decision === null) ctx.bail("approval timed out");
```

```ts
// Anywhere else (HTTP handler, webhook receiver, another workflow)
import { signal } from "tako.sh";
await signal(`approval:order-abc`, { approved: true });
```

Routing is by event name only — embed any selectors in the name. No JSON predicates server-side.

### Early exit: `ctx.bail` / `ctx.fail`

- `ctx.bail(reason?)` — end the run cleanly. Status: `cancelled`. No retries.
- `ctx.fail(error)` — end the run with failure. Status: `dead`. No retries (skips the run-level retry budget).

Both work via sentinel exceptions caught by the worker. Useful for "this work isn't needed anymore" (bail) and "this is permanently broken, don't bother retrying" (fail).

### Run statuses

`pending | running | succeeded | cancelled | dead`. Terminal: `succeeded`, `cancelled`, `dead`.

### Retries / backoff (run level)

- Failed handlers retry with exponential backoff (default base 1s, ±20% jitter, capped at 1h). Override via `defineWorkflow(name, { handler, retries, backoff })`. Default is 2 retries (3 total attempts).
- `attempts` bumps on every claim. When attempts reach the budget, the run moves to `dead`.
- `defer_run` (sleep, waitFor) decrements attempts so parking doesn't consume retry budget.

### Drain on stop / delete

- When `tako-server` stops an app through the internal `stop` command, scale-down, rolling replacement, service shutdown, or delete flow, it drains the worker first (SIGTERM, waits for in-flight, SIGKILL after 120s).
- On `tako delete`: drain first, then remove per-app data — in-flight runs get a chance to finish before the DB goes away.

### Communication model

- Single shared internal socket at `{tako_data_dir}/internal.sock` (symlink → `internal-{pid}.sock`, atomically swapped during upgrades for zero-downtime handoff — same pattern as the mgmt socket). Workflow RPCs and server-side channel publishes both land here, hence the role-neutral name.
- Every command carries an `app` field so one socket routes for every deployed app.
- Auth: filesystem permissions plus app-scoped runtime tokens. The socket is `chmod 0660` and group-accessible to the shared `tako-app` group so per-app users can connect through their supplementary group.
- SDKs read `TAKO_INTERNAL_SOCKET` and `TAKO_APP_NAME` env vars. HTTP instance and workflow worker spawners (tako-server in production and tako-dev-server in `tako dev`) share one env contract defined in `tako-core::instance_env::TakoRuntimeEnv` so the dev and prod runtimes can't drift. The SDK asserts the pair is set together at import time — a half-set env (one var without the other) is a platform bug and crashes the process on boot rather than silently failing at the first workflow enqueue or channel publish.
- From any process: `EnqueueRun`, `Signal`, `ChannelPublish` (server-side publish goes straight to the channel store instead of round-tripping through the HTTPS proxy).
- From worker processes: `ClaimRun`, `HeartbeatRun`, `SaveStep`, `CompleteRun`, `CancelRun`, `FailRun`, `DeferRun`, `WaitForEvent`, `RegisterSchedules`.
- The management socket rejects workflow/channel commands with an explicit "must be sent over the internal socket" error, and vice versa — the two sockets never cross wires even though they share the `Command` enum in `tako-core`.
- JSONL protocol, per-call connection (connect → send → read → close).
- Server → Worker for drain: SIGTERM + grace period (120s), then SIGKILL.

### Dev mode

`tako dev` uses the same workflow architecture as production: tako-dev-server owns the runs DB, internal socket, dispatcher, and a `WorkerSupervisor` that spawns a worker subprocess on demand. The worker is **scale-to-zero** (`workers: 0`, `idle_timeout_ms: 3_000`) so it only runs while there's runnable work, and each post-idle dispatch starts a fresh worker — so code edits take effect on the next runnable enqueue/signal/cron tick without restarting `tako dev`. Pressing `r` or changing workflow definitions also replaces the dev workflow runtime before the HTTP app process restarts. Worker stdout/stderr is tee'd into the same log stream as the app process, with `scope: "worker"` so the CLI can prefix it.

On every `RegisterApp`, the dev-server registers the app with its embedded `WorkflowManager` — same `ensure()` call as production — so the first workflow enqueue or channel publish from user code doesn't race the registration.

**Fail-fast on broken workers.** If the worker subprocess exits non-zero without claiming any run (typical for import errors, missing workflow module, crash on boot), the supervisor marks the app unhealthy for 5s. During that window, `EnqueueRun` returns `worker unhealthy: <reason>` instead of silently queuing work that will never execute. The SDK surfaces this to the caller as a normal error so broken dev code is loud instead of hanging. Clean idle-out (exit 0 after `idle_timeout_ms`) never marks unhealthy.

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all business logic (config parsing, validation, routing)
- Integration tests for critical paths (deploy, rolling updates, health checks)
- Edge case tests (deleted files, network failures, process crashes)
- Critical-path coverage target: >=80% line coverage across core modules (config parsing, runtime detection, routing, static file resolution, cold-start orchestration)
- TDD mandatory: write tests first, implement after tests pass

## Performance Targets

- Proxy throughput: Faster than Caddy, on par with Nginx
- Cold start: ~100-500ms for on-demand instances
- Health detection: immediate for exited processes; generally <10s for unresponsive health endpoints
- Deploy time: <1 minute for rolling update of 3 instances
- Memory: Minimal footprint with on-demand scaling
