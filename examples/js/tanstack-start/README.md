# TanStack Start Basic Example

TanStack Start example based on `TanStack/router/examples/react/start-basic`, with Tako deploy entry wrapping via `tako.sh/vite`.

## Local TanStack Dev

```bash
cd examples/js/tanstack-start
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Build for Deploy

```bash
cd examples/js/tanstack-start
bun run build
```

After build:

- `dist/server/tako-entry.mjs` is generated by `tako.sh/vite`.
- `package.json#main` points at the generated `tako-entry.mjs`.
- `assets` merges `dist/client` into `dist/public`.

## Notes

- `vite.config.ts` wires TanStack Start and `tako.sh/vite`.
- Deploy writes archive `app.json` as runtime manifest with the resolved `main`.
