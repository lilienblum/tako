If you've recently typed "open source Heroku alternative" into a search bar, you know the shape of what you want. One CLI. A clean deploy flow. Releases. Add-ons. Review apps. Scale-to-zero idle dynos. No Kubernetes, no AWS console, no Terraform — just a tool that points at your code and gets it on the internet.

The good news: in 2026, that tool is no longer Heroku-only. There's a whole field of self-hosted alternatives, and they're getting genuinely good. [Coolify](https://coolify.io) and [Dokku](https://dokku.com) each have north of 30k GitHub stars. [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org) made "deploy to your own servers" cool again. And [Tako](https://tako.sh) is the newest member of the club, with an opinion you won't find elsewhere: ship the Heroku DX _without_ Docker.

This post is a tour. We'll start with the Heroku features that everyone in the self-hosted space is rebuilding (because they got the DX right), then look at where the alternatives — including us — fit on the map.

## The Heroku DX, broken down

The reason "the Heroku alternative" has lasted as a search query for fifteen years isn't nostalgia — it's that a small set of primitives still defines what good app deployment feels like. When teams rebuild that experience, these are the boxes they're trying to check:

| Heroku primitive      | What it does                                             | What you'd build by hand                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Buildpacks**        | Auto-detect runtime, install deps, run build             | Dockerfile + CI YAML per language         |
| **`git push` deploy** | One command from local to live                           | Git remote + CI + deploy script           |
| **Add-ons**           | One-click Postgres, Redis, etc.                          | Provision DBs + manage credentials        |
| **Release phase**     | One-shot command (e.g. migrations) before traffic shifts | Ad-hoc shell script + manual coordination |
| **Review apps**       | Per-PR preview environments                              | Custom CI + ephemeral infra               |
| **Pipelines**         | Promote builds across environments                       | Multi-stage CI workflow                   |
| **Eco dynos**         | Idle-time hibernation, fast wake                         | Process supervisor + custom proxy         |
| **`heroku run`**      | One-off REPL or task in prod env                         | SSH + remembering env vars                |

Any "Heroku alternative" is, implicitly, a re-implementation of that table.

## How Tako maps to it

Tako is a CLI deploy tool with a Rust [Pingora-based proxy](/blog/pingora-vs-caddy-vs-traefik) that runs on a Linux box with SSH. It explicitly targets Heroku-shaped DX, but rebuilds each piece around native processes instead of containers.

| Heroku primitive       | Tako equivalent                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Buildpacks             | [Presets](/docs/presets) + runtime auto-detection (Bun, Node, Deno, Go) — no Docker in the loop                                                                               |
| `git push heroku main` | `tako deploy` — build locally, ship via SFTP, rolling update                                                                                                                  |
| Add-ons                | Bring-your-own services via [secrets](/docs/cli) and `TAKO_DATA_DIR`. Channels, queues, and image optimization are [on the platform roadmap](/blog/durable-channels-built-in) |
| Release phase          | [`release` field in tako.toml](/blog/the-release-command-database-migrations-during-deploy) — runs on the leader server, blocks rollout on failure                            |
| Review apps            | `[envs.preview]` environments with their own `route`, `servers`, and `release`                                                                                                |
| Pipelines              | Multiple `[envs.<name>]` blocks promoted by re-deploying with `--env`                                                                                                         |
| Eco dynos              | [Scale-to-zero on by default](/blog/scale-to-zero-without-containers) — idle timeout, cold start, queue up to 1000 waiters                                                    |
| `heroku run`           | `tako logs`, `tako secrets`, SSH for one-off shell                                                                                                                            |

A single [`tako.toml`](/docs/tako-toml) ties it together — preview, staging, production, with their own routes, secrets, and release commands:

```toml
name = "my-app"
preset = "tanstack-start"
release = "bun run db:migrate"

[envs.production]
route = "app.example.com"
servers = ["la", "nyc"]

[envs.preview]
route = "preview.example.com"
servers = ["preview"]
release = ""   # share staging DB, skip migrations
```

## How Tako compares with the other alternatives

Tako isn't alone. The "open source Heroku" space in 2026 has real diversity, and each project picks a different point on the dashboard-vs-CLI and Docker-vs-native axes:

| Tool                              | Stars | Interface     | Runtime      | Proxy       | Buildpacks                       | Release phase       | Scale-to-zero |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| [Coolify](https://coolify.io)     | ~52k  | Web UI        | Docker       | Traefik     | Nixpacks                         | Pre/post hooks      | No            |
| [Dokku](https://dokku.com)        | ~32k  | CLI + plugins | Docker       | nginx       | Buildpacks, Nixpacks, Dockerfile | Procfile `release:` | No            |
| [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com)    | ~32k  | Web UI        | Docker Swarm | Traefik     | Nixpacks                         | Hooks               | No            |
| [CapRover](https://caprover.com)  | ~15k  | Web UI        | Docker Swarm | nginx       | Captain definition               | Custom              | No            |
| [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org) | ~14k  | CLI           | Docker       | kamal-proxy | Dockerfile                       | `pre-deploy` hook   | No            |
| [Piku](https://piku.github.io)    | ~7k   | git push      | Native       | nginx       | Procfile-style                   | Procfile `release:` | No            |
| **Tako**                          | newer | CLI           | Native       | Pingora     | Presets                          | `release` field     | **Default**   |

A few things fall out of the table:

- **Most options still ship Docker as the runtime substrate.** Piku and Tako are the two outliers that run your app as a native process. That's a clean tradeoff — Docker buys you a portable artifact and isolation, native buys you simpler servers and faster cold starts.
- **Scale-to-zero is rare.** Heroku's Eco dynos popularized it; almost nobody in the self-hosted space ships it on by default. Tako does, because [we think it's the only honest way](/blog/scale-to-zero-without-containers) to run multiple low-traffic apps on one $6 VPS.
- **Release phase is patchier than you'd expect.** Dokku and Piku inherit Heroku's Procfile `release:` line; Coolify and Dokploy use generic pre/post hooks; Kamal has `pre-deploy`. [Tako's `release` field](/blog/the-release-command-database-migrations-during-deploy) is the only one designed around multi-server leader/follower coordination, which matters once you have more than one box.

We're not knocking the others — Coolify in particular has built something genuinely impressive, and we've [written about it](/blog/tako-vs-coolify) elsewhere. They're solving a slightly different problem: orchestrating containers and services through a UI. Tako is solving "make a CLI deploy feel like Heroku, on bare Linux, in Rust."

## Where Tako goes past parity

Heroku's DX was excellent for 2010. It hasn't really moved since then — and parity, by definition, stops there. Tako starts from that floor and builds one more story up: durable [channels](/blog/durable-channels-built-in) for WebSocket/SSE, [workflows](/blog/durable-workflows-are-here) for background jobs, and image optimization, all in the same `tako-server` binary that already routes traffic on your VPS.

In Heroku terms: imagine if the add-ons weren't external services with their own bills, but built into the dyno manager. That's where we're going.

If you're searching for the open source Heroku alternative for 2026, the right answer depends on whether you want a UI (Coolify), a Docker-with-buildpacks classic (Dokku), Docker-via-CLI (Kamal), or a CLI that drops Docker entirely and goes beyond deploy (Tako). Pick what fits — [our docs](/docs) are here when you want to try the last one.
