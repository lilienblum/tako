[Coolify](https://coolify.io) is the most popular open-source self-hosted PaaS — 52k+ GitHub stars and growing. If you've ever searched "self-hosted Heroku," it's probably the first result. It gives you a polished web dashboard, one-click services, database management, and Docker-based deployment all in one package.

Tako takes a fundamentally different approach. No dashboard, no Docker, no bundled databases — just a CLI, native processes, and a [Pingora proxy](/blog/pingora-vs-caddy-vs-traefik). Both get your app running on your own hardware, but the philosophies couldn't be more different.

## Where Coolify shines

Coolify deserves its popularity. It's the closest thing the self-hosted world has to a real Heroku replacement — and it's genuinely impressive.

The web dashboard is the headline feature. You get a full GUI for managing servers, deploying apps, configuring domains, viewing logs, and setting environment variables. For teams that want visibility without SSH, that's a real advantage. There's even a browser-based terminal.

Service management goes well beyond app deployment. Need Postgres? Click a button. Redis, MongoDB, ClickHouse? Same. Coolify manages 280+ one-click services — from WordPress to Grafana to Plausible Analytics — and handles automated S3 backups for databases. For a solo developer running a handful of apps plus their supporting infrastructure, it can replace several tools at once.

The Git integration is solid. Connect GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, and Coolify builds on push with Nixpacks (auto-detects your stack), a Dockerfile, or Docker Compose. PR preview deployments work out of the box.

And it's genuinely free and open-source (Apache 2.0). There's a paid cloud offering, but the self-hosted version is the full product.

## Where Tako is different

### CLI, not dashboard

This is the fundamental philosophical split. Coolify is built around a web UI — you configure, deploy, and monitor through a browser. That's great for visual workflows and teams with mixed technical backgrounds.

Tako is CLI-first. Your entire deployment config lives in a single [`tako.toml`](/docs/tako-toml) that goes in version control. Deploy with `tako deploy`. Check status with `tako status`. No browser tab, no state living in a dashboard database. Everything is reproducible from the command line.

```bash
tako deploy          # build locally, ship to servers
tako status          # see what's running
tako logs -f         # tail logs
tako secrets set DB_URL=postgres://...
```

### No Docker on the server

Coolify runs everything as Docker containers — your apps, its own services, the databases it manages. That's powerful, but it means Docker is a hard requirement. Coolify itself runs as a Docker Compose stack (PostgreSQL + Redis + Soketi + the Laravel app), so just the platform layer uses meaningful resources before you deploy anything.

Tako's server requirement is a Linux box with SSH. Your app runs as a native process — no Docker daemon, no container overhead, no image layers. The [Pingora proxy](/blog/pingora-vs-caddy-vs-traefik), process management, and TLS termination are all built into a single Rust binary.

### Build locally, not on the server

Coolify builds your app on the server itself. That's convenient (no local build toolchain needed), but it means your servers need enough CPU and RAM for both building and running your apps. It also means build dependencies live on your production machines.

Tako builds locally on your machine and sends the compressed artifact over SFTP. Your server only needs to run the app, not build it. Deploys are faster and servers can be smaller.

### Integrated local dev

Coolify is a server-side platform. Local development is up to you.

[`tako dev`](/docs/development) runs your app with real HTTPS, local DNS (`*.tako.test`), and the same [SDK](/blog/why-tako-ships-an-sdk) and process model as production. What works locally works the same way when deployed.

## Different ambitions

Here's the bigger difference. Coolify is a platform management dashboard — and a good one. It deploys your app, manages your databases, handles your domains and certificates, and gives you a UI to control it all. But it stops at orchestration: once your container is running and Traefik is routing to it, you're on your own for everything else your app needs.

Tako is headed somewhere different. We're building the **platform layer between your code and the internet**. Today that's deployment, routing, TLS, [secrets](/docs/deployment), and local dev. The roadmap includes backend primitives that most apps end up bolting on as separate services: WebSocket and SSE channels, background queues, workflows, and image optimization — all built into the same server binary that's already running your app.

Combined with [multi-server environments](/docs/deployment) and Cloudflare smart routing, Tako lets you build your own edge network on commodity VPS boxes. Deploy to LA, NYC, Frankfurt, and Singapore with one command. Think Fly.io, but on your own hardware.

```toml
[envs.production]
servers = ["la", "nyc", "fra", "sgp"]
```

Your app handles your business logic. Tako handles everything underneath.

## Choose your style

**Choose Coolify if** you want a visual dashboard for managing servers and services, you need managed databases and one-click apps alongside your code, your team prefers browser-based workflows over terminal, or you want a single tool that replaces multiple pieces of infrastructure.

**Choose Tako if** you want fast, CLI-driven deploys without Docker, your config belongs in version control not a dashboard, you want integrated local dev that matches production, or you want a platform that's growing beyond deployment into the infrastructure your app actually needs.

Both tools believe in the same thing: your own hardware is a great place to run your software. Coolify approaches that with a dashboard and managed services. Tako approaches it with a CLI and a growing platform layer. Different tools for different people — and that's a good thing.
