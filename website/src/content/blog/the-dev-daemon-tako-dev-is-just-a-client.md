Most "dev mode" commands are watcher scripts. They spawn your app as a child process, tail its stdout, and when you hit `Ctrl+c` everything dies together. The shell tab IS the dev environment.

[`tako dev`](/docs/development) doesn't work like that. It's a thin client that talks to a long-running daemon. The daemon owns your app process, your logs, your routes, and your TLS. The CLI is just the friendly face you see in the terminal — pay no attention to the daemon behind the curtain.

## What lives where

When you run `tako dev`, the CLI does almost nothing interesting. It checks that the daemon is up (spawns it if not), registers your selected `tako.toml` with it, then opens a stream and starts rendering log lines. That's it.

| Concern             | Daemon (`tako-dev-server`) | CLI (`tako dev`)                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| App processes       | Spawn, supervise, restart  | —                               |
| HTTPS termination   | Local CA + SNI cert select | —                               |
| Routing             | Host-header proxy          | —                               |
| DNS for `*.test`    | Local resolver on `:53535` | —                               |
| Log persistence     | Shared per-app stream      | —                               |
| Registry            | SQLite at `dev-server.db`  | —                               |
| Header + log render | —                          | Pretty-print stream to terminal |
| Keystrokes          | —                          | Send `restart`/`stop` to daemon |

```d2
direction: right

cli1: tako dev (terminal A) {style.fill: "#9BC4B6"}
cli2: tako dev (terminal B) {style.fill: "#9BC4B6"}
daemon: Dev Daemon {style.fill: "#E88783"}
db: SQLite registry {style.fill: "#FFF9F4"; style.stroke: "#2F2A44"}
log: shared log stream {style.fill: "#FFF9F4"; style.stroke: "#2F2A44"}
app: Your App {shape: hexagon}

cli1 -> daemon: register + subscribe
cli2 -> daemon: register + subscribe
daemon -> db: persist
daemon -> app: spawn + supervise
app -> log: stdout / lifecycle
log -> cli1: replay + tail
log -> cli2: replay + tail
```

Two terminals tailing the same app see the same log stream because the daemon is the source of truth. Close one — the other keeps going. Close both — the daemon keeps your app running.

## The shape this gives you

Because the daemon outlives any single CLI, four things become natural:

**Background a session.** Press `b` and the CLI exits. The daemon keeps the process alive, keeps the routes registered, keeps the logs flowing into the file. Run `tako dev` again later (today, tomorrow) and you reattach to the same session — header reprinted, scrollback replayed, status restored.

**Run multiple apps at once.** Each `tako.toml` path is a unique key in the registry. Open one terminal in your frontend project, another in your API project — both register with the same daemon, both get their own [`{app}.test` route](/blog/local-dev-with-real-https), both serve traffic concurrently. No port juggling.

**Wake on request.** After 30 minutes of no attached CLI, an app transitions to `idle` — the process stops, but the route stays registered. The next HTTP request triggers a respawn, the daemon waits for it to be healthy, and forwards the request. Your laptop is quiet when you're not using it; your URLs still work when you are.

**Survive client crashes.** If your terminal dies, your shell freezes, or you accidentally kill the wrong PID, the daemon doesn't care. Your app keeps serving. Reopen a terminal, run `tako dev`, you're back where you were.

## Why we built it this way

The honest reason: process and log lifecycle are too important to live in a process the user might Ctrl+c at any moment. Watcher scripts work fine for one app and one terminal — they fall over the moment you want two terminals attached, or want to background a long-running session, or want a flaky shell to not take your dev environment down with it.

A daemon also gives us somewhere to put things that genuinely span apps: the [proxy](/blog/pingora-vs-caddy-vs-traefik), the local DNS server, the [`.local` LAN aliases](/blog/lan-mode-hand-your-app-to-a-phone), the local CA. Those are infrastructure, not per-app concerns. They belong in one place that knows about all your registered apps.

It's the same architectural choice as production Tako, scaled down: a small, durable service that owns the messy parts so your code doesn't have to. See the [development docs](/docs/development) for the full picture, or the [CLI reference](/docs/cli) for every flag and keystroke.
