Most devs shipping today are paying Render, Railway, or Vercel. Those platforms earned it — the DX is genuinely good. Push a branch, get a URL. TLS handled. Deploys handled. Zero SSH.

Tako can't beat "zero servers to think about." That's not the pitch. The pitch is: everything those platforms make easy, Tako makes equally easy on hardware you already own.

## What managed PaaS gets right

These platforms solved real problems. Render's build detection figures out the right install and start commands without a config file. Railway's UX became the benchmark that other deploy tools are measured against. Vercel's edge network and tight Next.js integration are genuinely hard to beat for frontend-heavy apps.

The shared idea — you shouldn't need to understand infrastructure to ship code — is a good idea. We took it seriously when designing Tako.

## Cold starts without the container overhead

Every platform on that table supports scale-to-zero. But what happens during a cold start differs a lot depending on the runtime.

Render and Railway run Docker containers. Waking an idle container means loading image layers back into memory, initializing a network namespace, and waiting for the process inside to boot. Render's own docs put free-tier wake-up time around 50 seconds. Railway is faster — Nixpacks images tend to be leaner — but container overhead is container overhead.

Vercel's serverless functions use V8 isolates, which boot much faster. But V8 isolates aren't Node.js: they have package size limits, execution time caps, and restricted APIs. You're not deploying your app to a different host; you're rewriting it for a constrained runtime.

Tako's [scale-to-zero](/blog/scale-to-zero-without-containers) is a native process spawn. No image to unpack, no namespace to create, no container runtime. The cold start is `fork()` plus your app's initialization time — often tens of milliseconds for a lightweight API. That's competitive with Vercel's cold starts, from a $6 VPS, running your unmodified app.

```d2
direction: right

render: Render cold start {
  direction: down
  layers: Image layers
  ns: Network namespace
  boot: Process boot
  layers -> ns -> boot
  style.fill: "#FFF9F4"
}

tako: Tako cold start {
  direction: down
  fork: fork()
  init: App init
  ready: TAKO:READY
  fork -> init -> ready
  style.fill: "#9BC4B6"
}
```

## A shared vocabulary

Vercel popularized the fetch handler as the standard app interface:

```typescript
export default function (request: Request): Response {
  return new Response("hello");
}
```

That export runs on Vercel Functions, Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, and Bun natively. The interface is web-standard — `Request` and `Response` exist in every modern runtime. Frameworks like Hono and Elysia build on it directly, so a Hono app is already a fetch handler.

Tako uses [the same pattern](/blog/the-fetch-handler-pattern). Same export shape, same `Request`/`Response` objects. If your app already runs on Vercel, moving to Tako isn't a migration — it's picking a different host for code that was already portable. The [Tako SDK](/docs) handles the Node.js bridge automatically; on Bun and Deno it passes your handler straight through.

## The cost case

[We've covered the numbers in detail](/blog/your-5-dollar-vps-is-more-powerful-than-you-think), but the summary: a $6 Hetzner box has 4 GB of RAM and 20 TB of monthly bandwidth. Render's starter tier gives you 512 MB for $7. And managed PaaS billing compounds — each service adds to the line item, each seat adds to the bill.

The bigger shift is predictability. Render, Railway, and Vercel charge per service, per seat, or per invocation. Your VPS is a flat number. With Tako's [scale-to-zero](/blog/scale-to-zero-without-containers), a box running five apps only actually uses memory for the ones getting traffic — which means one VPS can comfortably host what would be three or four separate Render services.

## What Tako is becoming

Render and Railway handle your app's runtime. Vercel handles the frontend layer and edge. All three leave you reaching for separate services the moment you need WebSocket channels, durable queues, or long-running workflows — separate products, separate bills, separate config to maintain.

Tako's direction is to absorb those concerns into the same binary that's already routing your traffic. [Durable channels](/blog/durable-channels-built-in) are already shipping. Queues and workflows are next. The SDKs — [JavaScript/TypeScript and Go](/docs) — are how your app talks to all of it without caring which server it lands on.

The managed platforms have a head start on breadth. The advantage of doing it in one self-hosted binary is that every new primitive costs you nothing extra and runs on hardware you already paid for. [See how Tako works today](/docs/how-tako-works) for what's already shipped.

## When each makes sense

Pick **Render, Railway, or Vercel** if you want zero infrastructure — managed databases in one click, a dashboard your whole team can read, and a bill that someone else approved. They're well-run platforms and they earn it.

Pick **Tako** if you're already paying for a VPS, if PaaS billing is getting noisy across multiple services, or if container cold starts have burned you before. You get the same CLI-first deploy flow, the same fetch handler pattern, the same [scale-to-zero](/blog/scale-to-zero-without-containers) — on hardware you control, at a cost that doesn't compound with every new service you add.

The DX isn't a tradeoff. That's the point.
