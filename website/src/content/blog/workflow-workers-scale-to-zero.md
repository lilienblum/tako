Your workflow worker has a typo on line 3. It throws before it can claim a single run from the queue. The supervisor respawns it. It throws again. The queue fills up. Nothing runs. You find out hours later when someone asks why their password-reset email never arrived.

That's the failure mode we just closed. [Tako's workflow workers](/blog/durable-workflows-are-here) are scale-to-zero by default — no worker running until the first enqueue or cron tick — and when one exits non-zero before claiming any runs, the supervisor marks the app unhealthy and the next `workflow.enqueue()` returns an error. No silent queueing, no phantom crash loop.

## The lifecycle

Workers track two signals: idle time (since the last claim) and claim count (since spawn). The supervisor treats those two signals differently on exit.

```d2
direction: right

zero: Zero workers {style.fill: "#FFF9F4"; style.stroke: "#2F2A44"; style.font-size: 16}
spawn: Spawn on enqueue {style.fill: "#9BC4B6"; style.font-size: 16}
claim: Claim and process {style.fill: "#9BC4B6"; style.font-size: 16}
idle: Idle timeout (5 min) {style.fill: "#E88783"; style.font-size: 16}
crash: Exit before claim {style.fill: "#E88783"; style.font-size: 16}
unhealthy: Unhealthy cooldown {style.fill: "#E88783"; style.font-size: 16}

zero -> spawn: "first enqueue or cron tick"
spawn -> claim: "bootstrap OK"
claim -> idle: "no work for 5 min"
idle -> zero: "clean exit (0)"
spawn -> crash: "non-zero exit, 0 claims"
crash -> unhealthy: "refuse respawn + enqueue"
unhealthy -> zero: "cooldown clears"
```

A clean idle-out (exit code 0 after at least one successful claim) is just the normal scale-to-zero path — the next enqueue spins a fresh worker. A cold crash (non-zero exit before any claim) is a bootstrap failure: the worker never got far enough to do real work, so respawning it is pointless and would hide the bug. The supervisor flips the app into an unhealthy cooldown, and the pre-enqueue health check rejects the next `enqueue` call with the actual exit reason.

## Why dev and prod share one supervisor

The same `WorkerSupervisor` runs workers under `tako dev` and in production. A unified env contract — concurrency, idle timeout, secrets on fd 3, the enqueue socket path — means a workflow that boots under `tako dev` boots the same way on a VPS. No "works in dev, broken in prod" drift from two subtly different spawners.

In dev, the worker is a subprocess of the embedded dev-server, and its stdout/stderr stream into your terminal alongside HTTP logs. When a bootstrap import throws, you see the stack trace immediately, then you see the next enqueue fail loudly with the same error. Fix the typo, save, re-run the enqueue — no restart needed.

## Configuration

Scale-to-zero is the default. Nothing to configure for a typical app:

```toml
# tako.toml
name = "my-app"
```

A workflow file in `workflows/` is enough — `tako dev` and `tako deploy` pick it up automatically. To pin workers up in production:

```toml
[workflows]
workers = 1
concurrency = 10
```

| Config         | Default | Meaning                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `workers = 0`  | yes     | Scale-to-zero. Spawn on enqueue, exit after 5 min idle with zero claimed runs. |
| `workers >= 1` | —       | Always-on. Respawn on any exit, including clean exits.                         |
| `concurrency`  | 10      | Max parallel runs per worker.                                                  |

See [`tako.toml`](/docs/tako-toml) for the full config surface and [SPEC.md](/docs) for the exact protocol.

## What the user sees

Before the cooldown existed, a broken workflow meant silent accumulation. Rows pile up in `runs.db`. The supervisor tries to be helpful and respawns the worker. Your logs fill with identical stack traces. Eventually someone notices nothing's running.

Now, the first enqueue after a cold crash returns `worker unhealthy: worker exited with status 1 after 84ms without claiming any runs`. That's the error your HTTP handler gets back from `sendEmail.enqueue()`, not a 500 from a crashed worker you never saw. The cooldown clears automatically once a worker claims a run — so a transient startup issue (a slow import, a cold filesystem) doesn't lock you out permanently.

Same ethos as the rest of Tako: [cold starts are fast](/blog/scale-to-zero-without-containers), failures are loud, nothing hides. Check [the docs](/docs) to see the whole stack, or the [CLI reference](/docs/cli) for the commands.
