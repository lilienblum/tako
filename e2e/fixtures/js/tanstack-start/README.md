# E2E TanStack Start Fixture

TanStack Start-style fixture app used by Docker deploy e2e tests.

## Run Deploy E2E Test

From repo root:

```bash
just e2e e2e/fixtures/js/tanstack-start
```

That runs the global Docker harness (`e2e/run.sh`) against this fixture path.

## Notes

- Source files are TanStack Start-style.
- Deploy tests run the fixture build so `tako.sh/vite` writes `dist/server/tako-entry.mjs`.
- Deploy entrypoint and `dist/client` asset merge come from the `bun-tanstack-start` preset defaults.
- SSH auth is handled with per-run ephemeral keys generated by the e2e harness.
- The harness runs a real `tako-server` binary on Docker test hosts (Ubuntu + AlmaLinux, no mock server).
- Post-deploy checks verify health JSON, root HTML response, and static/compiled asset reachability.
