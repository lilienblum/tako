/**
 * tako.sh/internal — server-only plumbing.
 *
 * Two audiences:
 *   - The generated `tako.gen.ts` file, which pulls `loadSecrets` and
 *     `createLogger` from here.
 *   - Framework-adapter authors wiring Tako into a new host (custom Vite
 *     plugin, Next.js middleware, edge adapter), who use
 *     `handleTakoEndpoint` to answer Tako's internal protocol requests.
 *
 * Not for app code. `loadSecrets` reads from an fd pipe and `createLogger`
 * writes JSON to `process.stdout`; do not import from here in browser
 * code. Client-side apps import from `tako.sh/client`; app server code
 * imports `workflowsEngine` and authoring helpers from `tako.sh`.
 *
 * Keep this surface narrow — anything re-exported here becomes
 * statically reachable from consumer bundlers, and side-effectful
 * bindings (like singletons) pull their source modules in even when the
 * named import isn't used.
