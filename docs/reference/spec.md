# Specification Reference

The authoritative Tako specification remains at repo root:

- `../../SPEC.md`

This reference file exists so the `docs/` hierarchy has a stable entrypoint to the canonical spec.

## Use This When

- you need finalized command/config/runtime behavior,
- you are updating implemented behavior and must sync docs with code,
- you need protocol-level contract details.
